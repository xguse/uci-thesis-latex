\paragraph*{Complementary sets of TFBS models:}
\gls{PTCI} data was calculated using two complementary sets of \gls{TFBS} models.
%
One set focuses the \gls{PTCI} on genes that have been associated with \gls{20E} and its nuclear receptor (\PTCIe) (Figures \ref{fig:ecr-pair-ptci-hists} and \ref{fig:ecr-mean-ptci-hists}), and a second provides a general focus on \gls{TFBS} models provided by JASPAR that are defined in insects at large (\PTCIi) (Figures \ref{fig:insect-pair-ptci-hists} and \ref{fig:insect-mean-ptci-hists}).
%
\FDR\ estimation was used to determine a suitable \PTCI\ value to use as a threshold for further investigating particular 3-way 1:1 ortholog sets.
%
It was determined that in both \gls{TFBS} model data-sets a mean \PTCI\ threshold of 0.95 yielded an \FDR\ of approximately 15\% and maximized the number of genes for further classification (Figures \ref{fig:ecr-mean-ptci-hists-fdr} and \ref{fig:insect-mean-ptci-hists-fdr}).
%
This threshold produced 666 and 708 genes in the \PTCIi\ and \PTCIe\ sets, respectively.
%
The union of these gene-sets was 930 genes or 310 genes from each species.
%
The intersection was 444 or an overlap of 66\% of the \PTCIi\ genes and 62.7\% of the \PTCIe\ genes.
%
The unique proportion contributed by each set are 33\% and 37.3\%, respectively.

\paragraph*{Mean vs pairwise PTCI:}
Comparing the \FDR\ values of the pairwise- and mean-\PTCI\ scores at the 0.95 threshold reveals the impact of considering information from all 3-way 1:1 orthologs simultaneously rather than species-pair by species-pair (Figures \ref{fig:ecr-pair-ptci-hists-fdr} vs \ref{fig:ecr-mean-ptci-hists-fdr} and Figures \ref{fig:insect-pair-ptci-hists-fdr} vs \ref{fig:insect-mean-ptci-hists-fdr}).
%
The quality, as judged by \FDR, is strikingly improved by including the relationships of all three species weighted by their pairwise evolutionary distance: an improvement of approximately 30 percentage points in both cases.

\section{Characterization of Results}
These results pertain to the third stage of the approach described in Chapter \ref{chap:3} (Figure \ref{fig:approach-chart}: \textit{blue box}).

\subsection{Functional annotations (before k-means clustering)}

Functional annotations were obtained for the 930 genes using \gls{Argot2} (Section \ref{chap:3-sec:characterization-of-results}).
%
%% How many of the 930 were assigned at least one annotation >= 200? --> 760 (Aa:253 ,Ag:254 , Cq:253 )
%% How many genes got better than 2000? --> 452 (Aa: 154, Ag:153 , Cq:145 )
Of these, 760 were assigned, by \gls{Argot2}, at least one annotation with a \gls{TS} greater than or equal to 200\footnote{This is the threshold that is suggested by the developers based on their in-house benchmarking \url{http://www.medcomp.medicina.unipd.it/Argot2/help/argot\_scores.php\#ts}} (\Aa: 253, \Ag: 254, \Cq: 253).
%
452 were assigned annotations with \glspl{TS} greater than or equal to 2000 (\Aa: 154, \Ag: 153, \Cq: 145).
%
This indicates that on the whole, most of the 930 genes produced by the \gls{gFunc} process were assigned annotations of a quality at least as stringent as used by the developers of \gls{Argot2}.

\subsection{K-means clustering}

K-means clustering ($k=23$) was applied to the 310 genes from \Ag\ to attempt to partition the 3-way 1:1 ortholog sets based on \gls{mAP} similarity.
%
\Ag\ was selected because it shares approximately equidistant evolutionary divergence to both other species.
%
Four of the resulting clusters were chosen for further characterization (Figure \ref{fig:23-clusters}: \textit{Cluster IDs 4, 6, 16, and 22}) because they have expression patterns that may be regulated by a noted pulse of \gls{20E} that occurs around 4h \gls{PBM}\footnote{See Section \ref{chap:3-sec:clustering-of-filtered-ortholog-sets} for more information.}.
