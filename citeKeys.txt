0_introduction.tex:Perhaps most famously, \gls{SIT} was used successfully to eradicate the screwworm from the southern United States in the 1950s \cite{Bushland1955}.
0_introduction.tex:The number of locations and number of copies at any \textbf{single} genomic location was unpredictable \cite{Adelman2004,Sethuraman2007}.
0_introduction.tex:However, with the successful implementation of the \gls{phic31} site-specific integration system in \Aa\ and \As\ \cite{Thorpe1998,Nimmo2006,Isaacs2012}, we can now reliably target specific, pre-characterized regions of these genomes for transgene integration of a single copy.
0_introduction.tex:Strain OX3604C represents a female-specific \gls{RIDL} approach which uses a poison transgene that kills any female adult expressing the transgene unless the female is provided an ``antidote'' through its water supply \cite{WisedeValdez2011,Bargielowski2012,Facchinelli2013}.
0_introduction.tex:An example of a \textbf{transgenic tactic} for population conversion of \Aa\ into a transmission-deficient phenotype involves an effector gene that produces a double stranded RNA molecule that contains a portion of the dengue virus genome \cite{Franz2006,Mathur2010}.
0_introduction.tex:In \cite{Moreira2000}, the promoter sequences of a gene called carboxypeptidase (normally expressed in the midgut after a meal) from \Aa\ and \Ag\ were inserted in front of a reporter gene.
0_introduction.tex:From the abstract of \cite{Moreira2000}:
