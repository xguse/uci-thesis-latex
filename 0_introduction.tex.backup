\section{Dengue fever and malaria are mosquito borne diseases}

\synopsis{
\begin{itemize}
\item there are many but we focus on Dengue Fever and Malaria
\item causative agents are RNA viruses and Plasmodium protists, respectively
\item people don't give people these two diseases
\item mosquitoes generally don't give mosquitoes these diseases
\end{itemize}
}

There are many mosquito borne diseases that afflict the world's population; \alert{however, the James Lab focuses on two of the major ones: dengue fever and malaria}.
The causative agents of these two diseases are a suite of four species of RNA viruses (Dengue Virus 1-4) and a suite of five species of protist from the genus \textit{Plasmodium}, respectively.
However, in any \textbf{single} geographic location they are generally transmitted by a single species of mosquito \alert{CITEME}. 

\alert{TABLE HERE}

The fact that both of these diseases are caused by multiple pathogen species complicates efforts to prevent human disease: particularly when addressed from the perspective of providing therapeutic or prophylactic care directly to human patients.

\section{The transmission cycles of dengue fever and malaria require mosquitoes}

Another very important aspect of both of these diseases is that people do not become infected through interaction with other people, and mosquitoes do not become infected through interaction with other mosquitoes.
The transmission cycles transmission of both diseases require that the pathogen be passed from human to mosquito or from mosquito to human.
This pattern has important consequences that we can exploit to prevent the transmission cycle from producing as many infected individuals.

\subsection{Transmission cycle}

\begin{enumerate}
\item a female mosquito bites infected person
\item the pathogen is taken into mosquito midgut with bloodmeal
\item the pathogen must escape the midgut and gain access to the mosquito's circulatory system (the animal is now \textbf{infected})
\item the pathogen must gain access to the mosquito's salivary glands (the animal is now \textbf{infectious})
\item the infectious female mosquito bites an uninfected human and pathogens in her saliva are introduced to the person's body
\end{enumerate}
While the specifics of how viruses and protists live and reproduce in mosquitoes and humans are quite different, the transmission cycles of dengue and malaria are very similar in their major events.
The transmission of either pathogen from one infected human to another can both be summarized into five fundamental events.
First, a female mosquito feeds on an infected human's blood taking up the pathogen as well.
The bloodmeal is digested in the mosquito's midgut, \alert{and as you might expect, the midgut is the first stop for the pathogen too.}
Escape of the midgut is the first critical step for the survival of the pathogen inside the mosquito.
If it is trapped in the midgut, it will eventually be passed as waste after the bloodmeal is digested.
If it manages to escape to the \gls{hemolymph}, the pathogen must gain access to the mosquito's salivary glands if it is to infect another human.
If this step is unsuccessful, then the mosquito, while itself \textbf{infected}, is not \textbf{infectious} to other humans.
For this, the pathogen must be injected into the bloodstream of the next human along with the contents of the mosquito's saliva.

\section{Public health: \emph{multiple targets}}

\synopsis{
\begin{itemize}
\item The specifics of the transmission cycle of these diseases provides multiple targets for public health interventions
\item focus on the human
\item focus on the vector
\end{itemize}
}

Because the arrow of transmission always \footnote{While some mosquito
  to non-human vertebrate transmission may occur, it is not thought to
  be sufficient to maintain the pathogen if the mosquito:human loop is
  broken.} points from mosquito to human or from human to mosquito, if either of those arrows are broken, the cycle will collapse and the area would eventually be cleared of the pathogen provided the intervention is maintained.
This model suggests that there are two primary targets for public health interventions aiming to reduce the :term:`incidence`
(followed by :term:`prevalence`) of infection in a population.

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item
  prevent mosquitoes from infecting humans
\item
  prevent humans from infecting mosquitoes
\end{enumerate}

However, many of the interventions can not be clearly divided into addressing purely the human or vector side of the cycle.
For example, any efforts to reduce the number of bites that humans receive from mosquitoes affects both the probabilities of the vector \emph{and} the human becoming infected.
This is one reason that vector control rather than purely human-based interventions are almost always part of prevention strategies.
For the purposes of this document, I will define human-based interventions to be those that are directly administered to the human's body.
Essentially: medical interventions.

It should be noted that in this respect, the long term goals of public health are more focused on prevention than the treatment of acute cases.

Of course sick people need to be treated, and finding and clearing people who are infected is a part of preventing mosquitoes from acquiring the pathogen from people.
However, in the long game it is much more effective to prevent the infection.
These efforts are what we will focus on.

\subsection{Options for the humans}

Because of the definition of human-based interventions that I am using, there are relatively few effective options in this category for malaria and dengue fever.
Normally, this section would include vaccines and swift, effective patient identification and treatment to clear the infection.
\alert{For reasons that will be discussed in a later post, these interventions simply do not exist on the market or in a cost-effective form applicable to the isolated and impoverished areas that are most affected.}

\subsection{Conventional options for the vectors}

Because medical options are generally quite scarce, most attention in the field is directed toward controlling access of the vector populations to human contact.
This can include removal of nearby mosquito breeding sites (usually standing water), spraying of insecticides, introduction of biological predators, and/or bed nets, etc.
One fairly novel approach that has implications for the next post in this series is sterile insect technique.



\subsection{Sterile Insect Technique}
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterile\_insect\_technique}{Sterile insect technique (SIT)} exploits a peculiar aspect of some insects' reproductive behavior. 
In many insects, it is only (or at least
primarily) the first mating event that ``matters''.
Subsequent mating events contribute little to no genetic material to the females progeny, \textbf{even when the first event involves a sterile male}.
This means that if massive numbers of sterilized males are introduced into a native population, any wild female that mates first with one of the sterile males will be effectively sterilized herself.
This can have dramatic effects on the local population.
For a famously effective SIT campaign, look up \href{http://goo.gl/DF7bv}{screwworm eradication} on google.


\section{Transgenic options for the vectors}

Most conventional vector control strategies involve what might be termed \textbf{vector population reduction}.
As we get into what transgenics can do for vector control, we will see that in addition to population reduction we have a new strategy available which has quite exciting implications to the sustainability of the vector control aspect of public health interventions for dengue and malaria.
This could be called \textbf{vector population conversion}.
