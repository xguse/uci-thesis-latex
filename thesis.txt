Review of Literature Contributions and Development of Analytical Approach

Purpose
Review a selection of my contributions to the literature that have informed the approach use din this project throughout my tenure as a member of the lab

 Comparative genomics allows the discovery of cis-regulatory elements in mosquitoes
  
   Use of comparative genomics to discover putative CREs from orthologous promoter regions in mosquitoes that were able to be corelated with bloodmeal associated transcription control
  
 RNA-seq analyses of blood-induced changes in gene expression in the mosquito vector species, Aedes aegypti
  
   relevance
  

 Strain Variation in the Transcriptome of the Dengue Fever Vector, Aedes aegypti
   
   relevance
  
 Comparative Transcriptome Analyses of Deltamethrin-Resistant and-Susceptible Anopheles gambiae Mosquitoes from Kenya by RNA-Seq
   
   relevance
