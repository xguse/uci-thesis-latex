A: The expression and TFBS profile correlations each carry the same weight.  TFBS data is not strictly empirical, and position weight matrix models inherently are prone to produce false positive predictions. Here, each correlation-type exerts equal influence on the final score assigned to the ortholog relationship.  B: The TFBS profile correlation is penalized due to the non-empirical nature and expected false positive information it contains. Here, TFBS profile data contributes to the final score at most 50\% as much as expression data.}
