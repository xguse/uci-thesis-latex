	This figure demonstrates the complexities of a typical RNA-seq experiment as analyzed with the \gls{TuxProt}. It models a fairly \textbf{simple} two condition experiment with each condition having three replications. It is ``abbreviated'' in that it only displays the output files that will be used in the next step for all steps except the \UseVerb{cuffdiff} step. The complete output of \UseVerb{cuffdiff} is included to demonstrate the final challenge of integrating the data which exists in multiple cross-referenced files.\\

	\emph{Green} - Inputs Specific to the Reference Genome; 
	\emph{Gold} - Program Calls)
