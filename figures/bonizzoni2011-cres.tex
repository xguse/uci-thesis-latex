\caption[Motif map of putative CREs from transcripts detected only in bloodfed female \Aa]{\sf \textbf{Motif map of putative CREs discovered by SCOPE using transcripts detected significantly only in bloodfed female \Aa:} Locations of representative SCOPE-derived CRE motifs in the 2000 bp upstream of the annotated translational start site in the 40 transcripts detected significantly only in bloodfed females. Transcript names on the left are ordered from most (top) to least (bottom) abundant.  Candidate CRMs are highlighted in like-colored rectangles.
