\chapter{Development of Analytical Approach}

\section{Purpose}
Review a selection of my contributions to the literature that have informed the approach used in this project throughout my tenure as a member of the lab
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Comparative genomics allows the discovery of cis-regulatory elements in mosquitoes
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Use of comparative genomics to discover putative CREs from orthologous promoter regions in mosquitoes that were able to be corelated with bloodmeal associated transcription control
  \end{itemize}
 \item RNA-seq analyses of blood-induced changes in gene expression in the mosquito vector species, Aedes aegypti
  \begin{itemize}
   \item relevance
  \end{itemize}

 \item Strain Variation in the Transcriptome of the Dengue Fever Vector, Aedes aegypti
   \begin{itemize}
   \item relevance
  \end{itemize}
 \item Comparative Transcriptome Analyses of Deltamethrin-Resistant and-Susceptible Anopheles gambiae Mosquitoes from Kenya by RNA-Seq
   \begin{itemize}
   \item relevance
  \end{itemize}
 \item Complex Modulation of the Aedes aegypti Transcriptome in Response to Dengue Virus Infection
   \begin{itemize}
   \item relevance
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
