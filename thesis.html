Dengue fever and malaria are two important such diseases resulting in major health and productivity deficits in many developing nations worldwide <FONT COLOR="fuchsia">CITEME</FONT>.

<H2 CLASS="section"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc3">1.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Hematophagy (bloodfeeding) is an essential part of mosquito-borne disease</H2><!--SEC END --><P>Another very important aspect of both of these diseases is that people do not become infected through interaction with other people, and mosquitoes do not become infected through interaction with other mosquitoes.
The transmission cycles transmission of both diseases require that the pathogen be passed from human to mosquito or from mosquito to human.
This pattern has important consequences that can be exploited to reduce the number of people who will become infected with dengue fever or malaria.</P><!--TOC subsection Transmission cycle-->

<DIV CLASS="center"><HR WIDTH="80%" SIZE=2></DIV></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE><P>While the specifics of how viruses and protists live and reproduce in mosquitoes and humans are quite different, the transmission cycles of dengue and malaria are very similar in their critical events.
The transmission cycle of either pathogen type can be encapsulated into five fundamental events.
First, a female mosquito feeds on an infected human&#X2019;s blood taking up the pathogen as well (Figure <A HREF="#fig:mosq-xsection">??</A>).
The bloodmeal is digested in the mosquito&#X2019;s midgut, and escape from the midgut is the first crucial step for the survival of the pathogen inside the mosquito.
If it is trapped in the midgut, it will eventually be passed as waste after the bloodmeal is digested.
If it manages to escape to the hemolymph, the pathogen must survive long enough to gain access to the mosquito&#X2019;s salivary glands.
If it is unable to infiltrate the salivary glands, then the mosquito, while itself <B>infected</B>, is not <B>infectious</B> to other humans.
For this, the pathogen must be injected into the bloodstream of the next human along with the contents of the mosquito&#X2019;s saliva.</P><!--TOC section Public health: <EM>multiple targets</EM>-->

points from mosquito to human or from human to mosquito, the cycle will collapse and a local area would eventually be cleared of the pathogen if either of those arrows are broken, provided that the intervention is maintained.
This model suggests two primary targets for public health interventions aiming to reduce the incidence
(followed by prevalence) of infection in a population.</P><OL CLASS="enumerate" type=1><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">
Prevent mosquitoes from infecting humans.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">Prevent humans from infecting mosquitoes.
</LI></OL><P>However, many interventions can not be clearly divided into addressing purely the human or vector side of the cycle.
For example, efforts to reduce the number of bites that humans receive from mosquitoes affects both the probabilities of the vector <EM>and</EM> the human becoming infected.
This is one reason that vector control is almost always part of prevention strategies <FONT COLOR="fuchsia">CITEME</FONT>.
For the purposes of this document, I will define human-based interventions to be those that are directly administered to a human body.
Essentially: medical interventions.</P><P>In this respect, the long term goals of public health are more focused on prevention than the treatment of acute cases.
Of course sick people need to be treated. Additionally, identifying and curing people who are infected also prevents mosquitoes from acquiring the pathogen as well.
However, in the long term prevention is preferred.</P><!--TOC subsection Addressing the human side of the cycle-->
<H3 CLASS="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc6">1.3.1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Addressing the human side of the cycle</H3><!--SEC END --><P>Because of the definition of human-based interventions above, there are relatively few effective options in this category for malaria and dengue fever.
Normally, this section would include vaccines and swift, effective patient identification and treatment to clear the infection.
However, at this time these types of interventions simply do not exist on the market or in a cost-effective form applicable to the isolated and impoverished areas that are most affected <FONT COLOR="fuchsia">CITEME</FONT>.</P><!--TOC subsection Addressing the vector side of the cycle (conventionally)-->
<H3 CLASS="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc7">1.3.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Non-transgenic options for addressing the vector side of the cycle</H3><!--SEC END --><P>Medical options are scarce generally in the regions of the world where these diseases are most common.
The alternative is to focus attention toward controlling access of the vector populations to human contact.
This can include removal of nearby mosquito breeding sites (usually various forms of standing water), spraying of insecticides, introduction of biological predators, and/or bed nets, etc.
One fairly recently developed approach that has shown great promise is SIT.</P><!--TOC subsubsection Sterile insect technique-->
<H4 CLASS="subsubsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Sterile insect technique</H4><!--SEC END --><P>
SIT exploits a peculiar aspect of some insects&#X2019; reproductive behavior. 
In many insects, the first mating event provides the only genetic material that the female will use to fertilize her eggs for the rest of her life <FONT COLOR="fuchsia">CITEME</FONT>.
Subsequent mating events contribute little to no genetic material to the females progeny, <B>even if the first event involves a sterile male</B>.
This means that inundative numbers of sterilized males introduced into a native population will effectively sterilize significant proportions of wild females.
This has dramatic effects on the local population.
Negative population growth results from the inability of each generation to fully replace itself, and the effect is compounded for each subsequent generation as long as the program is maintained.
Perhaps most famously, SIT was used successfully to eradicate the screwworm from the southern United States in the 1950s [<A HREF="#Bushland1955">3</A>].</P><!--TOC subsection Transgenesis provides new vector control strategy-->
<H3 CLASS="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc8">1.3.3</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Transgenic techniques provide a new strategy for controlling disease transmission</H3><!--SEC END --><P>Most conventional vector control strategies involve what might be termed vector population-reduction.
In addition to population reduction, transgenic techniques provide a novel vector control strategy that has considerable implications to the sustainability of the vector control aspect of public health interventions for dengue and malaria.
In contrast to population reduction, this novel strategy could be conceptualized as vector population-conversion.
It&#X2019;s goal is not to reduce or eliminate contact between humans and vectors but to drive a transmission-refractory trait through the vector population that renders the vector unable to become infectious at all, converting it into a non-vector.</P><!--TOC section Elements of a successful transgenic vector control product-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc10">1.4.1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Introducing heritable transgenes into mosquito genomes</H3><!--SEC END --><P>Before one can employ transgenic methods for vector control, one must have the capacity to make transgenic vectors.
For mosquitoes, this is more labor intensive than for other fly species like <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>.
However, it has been accomplished, and protocols to reliably introduce transgenes into many mosquito species now exist <FONT COLOR="fuchsia">CITEME</FONT>.
Unfortunately, the relative difficulty is high.
It takes roughly 2-3 months to establish a stable line.
Thus many experimental approaches that are straightforward or even routine in <I>D. melanogaster</I>or other species remain impractical for mosquitoes.</P><P>The method of introducing a transgene into a mosquito genome generally relies on re-purposing the activities of transposon (transposable-element).
These nucleotide elements have the ability to cut themselves out of one part of the DNA and re-insert themselves into another.
It is possible to engineer them to insert selected transgenes into the mosquito genome instead of the genes that they usually contain.</P><P>Until recently, most if not all transposons used for transgenesis in mosquitoes inserted the transgenes into more-or-less random locations.
The number of locations and number of copies at any <B>single</B> genomic location was unpredictable [<A HREF="#Adelman2004">1</A>,<A HREF="#Sethuraman2007">10</A>].
This makes characterization of the effects of a transgene complicated.
However, with the successful implementation of the phic31 site-specific integration system in <I>Ae. aegypti</I> and <I>An. stephensi</I> [<A HREF="#Thorpe1998">11</A>,<A HREF="#Nimmo2006">9</A>,<A HREF="#Isaacs2012">6</A>], we can now reliably target specific, pre-characterized regions of these genomes for transgene integration of a single copy.</P><P>Heritability is achieved through specifically targeting the germline cells of mosquito embryos for transgenesis.
In flies like mosquitoes, the cells that will become the germline always position themselves at one end (or pole) of the embryo.
The transgenesis cocktail containing the transgene construct is injected into the embryos where the pole cells are located.
This means that the first generation of mosquitoes that may contain the transgene in every cell of their body is <B>not</B> the injected generation but the progeny of the injected mosquitoes.</P><!--TOC subsection Effector genes-->
<H3 CLASS="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc11">1.4.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Effector genes</H3><!--SEC END --><P>In addition to the ability to integrate transgene constructs into the vectors&#X2019; genomes, it is necessary to design constructs that contain transgenes that will effect a useful response in the vector.
Two broad strategies are commonly applied when designing an anti-transmission phenotype: population-reduction and population-conversion.</P><!--TOC subsubsection Vector population reduction:-->
<H4 CLASS="subsubsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Vector population reduction:</H4><!--SEC END --><P>The goal of vector population reduction is the same as conventional vector control modalities.
<EM>Reduce the local population of a disease vector with the goal of reducing the probability that an infectious individual will have an opportunity to participate in a transmission event.</EM></P><P>A <B>transgenic tactic</B> for the population reduction strategy is illustrated by Oxitec&#X2019;s <I>Ae. aegypti</I>strain OX3604C developed with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation&#X2019;s Grand Challenges for Global Health Initiative.
Strain OX3604C represents a female-specific RIDL approach which uses a poison transgene that kills any female adult expressing the transgene unless the female is provided an &#X201C;antidote&#X201D; through its water supply [<A HREF="#WisedeValdez2011">12</A>,<A HREF="#Bargielowski2012">2</A>,<A HREF="#Facchinelli2013">4</A>].</P><P>Releasing enough of these mosquitoes will affect the local mosquito species population in a way that is analogous to SIT.</P><!--TOC subsubsection Vector population conversion:-->
<H4 CLASS="subsubsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Vector population conversion:</H4><!--SEC END --><P>Vector population conversion is a novel strategy for vector control that primarily exists within the context of genetically altered vectors (<FONT COLOR="fuchsia">CITEME</FONT>wolbacia).
It promises to be the most long-lasting vector-focused intervention.
Unlike <B>all</B> vector population reduction tactics, there is a practical point in a conversion intervention (the anti-transmission trait works and is present in local populations at near 100%) when the human management of the intervention can be ceased, yet it continues to function.
For population reduction to approach this result, the vector species must not simply be eliminated from the local area, but approach elimination on a continental scale, or more realistically achieve global eradication.</P><P>The reason is that these mosquitoes (especially <I>Ae. aegypti</I>) can and do travel long distances, as eggs or larvae, in the backs of trucks (between villages) or in the pools of water collected in super-tankers (transcontinentally).
So a local village is only free of the vectors until more migrate into the area.
But in a conversion scenario, those migrants mate with the local vector population, and their offspring are assimilated into transmission-deficient mosquitoes.
The protection of the local village can be preserved <EM>even if some surrounding villages fail to maintain control of their mosquitoes</EM>.</P><P>An example of a <B>transgenic tactic</B> for population conversion of <I>Ae. aegypti</I> into a transmission-deficient phenotype involves an effector gene that produces a double stranded RNA molecule that contains a portion of the dengue virus genome [<A HREF="#Franz2006">5</A>,<A HREF="#Mathur2010">7</A>].
Because most animal cells have a system that detects and degrades double stranded RNA<SUP><A NAME="text2" HREF="#note2">2</A></SUP>
in a sequence specific manner, this primes the mosquito cells&#X2019; antiviral response to specifically attack the dengue virus if the effector gene is expressed in the cell before it gets infected.</P><!--TOC subsection Controlling when and where the effector genes are expressed-->
<H3 CLASS="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc12">1.4.3</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Controlling when and where the effector genes are expressed</H3><!--SEC END --><P>Even with an effector gene that clears 100% of the pathogen 100% of the time, the intervention will not be successful in limiting transmission if the transgene is not turned on at the right time and place.
If the transgene is most effective when the pathogen is in the midgut, it is not useful if the gene is only expressed in the antennae.</P><P>The region of DNA directly before the sequence of the gene is a major determinant of the pattern of expression and is referred to as the promoter.
It influences when the gene will be turned on (e.g., directly following the ingestion of a bloodmeal), and in which tissue type (e.g., the midgut).
Promoters influence the transcription of genes through the binding of special proteins called transcription factors that recognize specific DNA sequences called CRE.
CRE are sometimes organized into modules that represent groups of binding sites for a specific combination of transcription factors.
These modules are CRM <FONT COLOR="fuchsia">CITEME</FONT>(Figure <A HREF="#fig:cre-crm-intro-a">CREs make up CRMsfig:cre-crm-intro-aCREs make up CRMs20CREs make up CRMsControlling when and where the effector genes are expressedsubfigure.1</A>).
Once a set of transcription factors are bound to the promoter they recruit the special machinery needed for the gene to be turned on or silenced depending on the context of the cellular environment (Figure <A HREF="#fig:cre-crm-intro-b">??</A>).</P><BLOCKQUOTE CLASS="figure"><DIV CLASS="center"><HR WIDTH="80%" SIZE=2></DIV><P>[b].5@percent

The promoter from that gene would then be copied and inserted in front of our transgene in the final integration construct.</P><P>This is a very common process used to engineer the expression patterns of real transgenes in mosquitoes.
In [<A HREF="#Moreira2000">8</A>], the promoter sequences of a gene called carboxypeptidase (normally expressed in the midgut after a meal) from <I>Ae. aegypti</I> and <I>An. gambiae</I> were inserted in front of a reporter gene.</P><P>From the abstract of [<A HREF="#Moreira2000">8</A>]:</P><BLOCKQUOTE CLASS="quote">

To enable the population conversion strategies to work, genetic &#X201C;tricks&#X201D; must be exploited that cause the gene to spread through a mosquito population <B>much</B> faster than could happen naturally.
Efforts to discover or design these gene-drive systems are an on going and active area in this field.</P><P>An example of such a method is the Medea system successfully engineered in <I>D. melanogaster</I> (<FONT COLOR="fuchsia">CITEME</FONT>).</P><P><B>In Brief:</B>
