abstract = {The target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway regulates ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis, nutrient import, autophagy and cell cycle progression. After 30 years of concentrated attention, how TOR controls these processes is only now beginning to be understood. Recent advances have identified a wide array of TOR inputs, including amino acids, oxygen, ATP and growth factors, as well the regulatory proteins that facilitate their effects on TOR. Such proteins include AMPK, Rheb and the tumor suppressors LKB1, p53, and Tsc1/2. It has only recently been appreciated that TOR resides in two distinct signaling complexes with differing regulatory roles, only one of which is rapamycin-sensitive, thus opening a new avenue of inquiry into TOR function. Finally, TOR appears to regulate feeding behavior by facilitating communication between organ systems, and is thus implicated in the regulation of glucose and fat homeostasis, and possibly diabetes and obesity. TOR thus functions to coordinate growth-permitting inputs with growth-promoting outputs on both a cellular and an organismal level.},

abstract = {Blood feeding tightly regulates the reproductive cycle in anautogenous mosquitoes. Vitellogenesis (the synthesis of yolk protein precursors) is a key event in the mosquito reproductive cycle and is activated in response to a blood meal. Before blood feeding, Aedes aegypti is in a state of reproductive arrest during which the yolk protein precursor genes (YPPs) are repressed. The regulatory region of the major YPP gene vitellogenin (Vg) has multiple GATA-binding sites required for the high expression level of this gene. However, a GATA factor (AaGATAr) likely acts as a repressor, preventing activation of this gene before a blood meal. Here we report in vivo data confirming the role of AaGATAr as a repressor of the Vg gene at the state of previtellogenic arrest. Using an RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated technique in conjunction with the Sindbis viral expression system, we show that knockdown of the AaGATAr gene results in an increased basal level of expression of the Vg gene and an elevated response to the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone in mosquitoes in a state of arrest. These experiments have revealed a component in the molecular mechanism by which anautogeny is maintained in A. aegypti.},

We show that reverse-engineering algorithms are indeed able to correctly infer regulatory interactions among genes, at least when one performs perturbation experiments complying with the algorithm requirements. These algorithms are superior to classic clustering algorithms for the purpose of finding regulatory interactions among genes, and, although further improvements are needed, have reached a discreet performance for being practically useful.},

The domain involved in DNA interaction and the SH2 domain are well conserved. Ag-STAT is most similar to Drosophila D-STAT and to vertebrate STATs 5 and 6, constituting a proposed ancient class A of the STAT family. The mRNA is expressed at all developmental stages, and the protein is present in hemocytes, pericardial cells, midgut, skeletal muscle and fat body cells. There is no evidence of transcriptional activation following bacterial challenge. However, bacterial challenge results in nuclear translocation of Ag-STAT protein in fat body cells and induction of DNA-binding activity that recognizes a STAT target site. In vitro treatment with pervanadate (vanadate and H2O2) translocates Ag-STAT to the nucleus in midgut epithelial cells. This is the first evidence of direct participation of the STAT pathway in immune responses in insects.},

abstract = {The rapamycin-sensitive TOR signalling pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae activates a cell-growth program in response to nutrients such as nitrogen and carbon. The TOR1 and TOR2 kinases (TOR) control cytoplasmic protein synthesis and degradation through the conserved TAP42 protein. Upon phosphorylation by TOR, TAP42 binds and possibly inhibits type 2A and type-2A-related phosphatases; however, the mechanism by which TOR controls nuclear events such as global repression of starvation-specific transcription is unknown. Here we show that TOR prevents transcription of genes expressed upon nitrogen limitation by promoting the association of the GATA transcription factor GLN3 with the cytoplasmic protein URE2. The binding of GLN3 to URE2 requires TOR-dependent phosphorylation of GLN3. Phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention of GLN3 are also dependent on the TOR effector TAP42, and are antagonized by the type-2A-related phosphatase SIT4. TOR inhibits expression of carbon-source-regulated genes by stimulating the binding of the transcriptional activators MSN2 and MSN4 to the cytoplasmic 14-3-3 protein BMH2. Thus, the TOR signalling pathway broadly controls nutrient metabolism by sequestering several transcription factors in the cytoplasm.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association-rules discovery (ARD) technique has yet to be applied to gene-expression data analysis. Even in the absence of previous biological knowledge, it should identify sets of genes whose expression is correlated. The first association-rule miners appeared six years ago and proved efficient at dealing with sparse and weakly correlated data. A huge international research effort has led to new algorithms for tackling difficult contexts and these are particularly suited to analysis of large gene-expression matrices. To validate the ARD technique we have applied it to freely available human serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) data. RESULTS: The approach described here enables us to designate sets of strong association rules. We normalized the SAGE data before applying our association rule miner. Depending on the discretization algorithm used, different properties of the data were highlighted. Both common and specific interpretations could be made from the extracted rules. In each and every case the extracted collections of rules indicated that a very strong co-regulation of mRNA encoding ribosomal proteins occurs in the dataset. Several rules associating proteins involved in signal transduction were obtained and analyzed, some pointing to yet-unexplored directions. Furthermore, by examining a subset of these rules, we were able both to reassign a wrongly labeled tag, and to propose a function for an expressed sequence tag encoding a protein of unknown function. CONCLUSIONS: We show that ARD is a promising technique that turns out to be complementary to existing gene-expression clustering techniques.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The discovery of cis-regulatory motifs still remains a challenging task even though the number of sequenced genomes is constantly growing. Computational analyses using pattern search algorithms have been valuable in phylogenetic footprinting approaches as have expression profile experiments to predict co-occurring motifs. Surprisingly little is known about the nature of cis-regulatory element (CRE) distribution in promoters. RESULTS: In this paper we used the Motif Mapper open-source collection of visual basic scripts for the analysis of motifs in any aligned set of DNA sequences. We focused on promoter motif distribution curves to identify positional over-representation of DNA motifs. Using differentially aligned datasets from the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we convincingly demonstrated the importance of the position and orientation for motif discovery. Analysis with known CREs and all possible hexanucleotides showed that some functional elements gather close to the transcription and translation initiation sites and that elements other than the TATA-box motif are conserved between eukaryote promoters. While a high background frequency usually decreases the effectiveness of such an enumerative investigation, we improved our analysis by conducting motif distribution maps using large datasets. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to reveal positional over-representation of CREs and promoter motifs in a cross-species approach. CREs and motifs shared between eukaryotic promoters support the observation that an eukaryotic promoter structure has been conserved throughout evolutionary time. Furthermore, with the information on positional enrichment of a motif or a known functional CRE, it is possible to get a more detailed insight into where an element appears to function. This in turn might accelerate the in depth examination of known and yet unknown cis-regulatory sequences in the laboratory.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The case is made that tight junctions can undergo large reversible conductance changes in a matter of seconds and yet preserve their permselectivity. The diuretic peptide leucokinin transforms (renal) Malpighian tubules of the yellow fever mosquito from a moderately tight epithelium to a leaky epithelium by increasing the chloride-conductance of the paracellular shunt pathway. The nine-fold increase in the paracellular chloride-conductance brings about a non-selective stimulation of transepithelial sodium chloride and potassium chloride secretion, as expected from a conductance increase in the pathway taken by the counterion of sodium and potassium. RECENT FINDINGS: The leucokinin signaling pathway consists in part of a receptor coupled G-protein, phospholipase C, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate, and increased intracellular calcium concentration that bring about the increase in the paracellular, tight junction chloride-conductance. As the conductance of the tight junction pathway increases it becomes more selective for the transepithelial passage of chloride. SUMMARY: Epithelial cells in Malpighian tubules taper to tight junctions at their lateral edges exposing them directly to apical and serosal solutions. Furthermore, evolutionary pressures to excrete salt and water at high rates without the aid of glomerular filtration have led to powerful mechanisms of tubular secretion, capable of diuresis when the mosquito is challenged with the volume expansion of a blood meal. The tubular diuresis is mediated in part by increasing the paracellular chloride conductance. Thus, anatomical and physiological specializations in Malpighian tubules combine to yield the evidence for the dynamic hormonal regulation of the tight junction pathway.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the diversity of motif representations and search algorithms, the de novo computational identification of transcription factor binding sites remains constrained by the limited accuracy of existing algorithms and the need for user-specified input parameters that describe the motif being sought. RESULTS: We present a novel ensemble learning method, SCOPE, that is based on the assumption that transcription factor binding sites belong to one of three broad classes of motifs: non-degenerate, degenerate and gapped motifs. SCOPE employs a unified scoring metric to combine the results from three motif finding algorithms each aimed at the discovery of one of these classes of motifs. We found that SCOPE's performance on 78 experimentally characterized regulons from four species was a substantial and statistically significant improvement over that of its component algorithms. SCOPE outperformed a broad range of existing motif discovery algorithms on the same dataset by a statistically significant margin. CONCLUSION: SCOPE demonstrates that combining multiple, focused motif discovery algorithms can provide a significant gain in performance. By building on components that efficiently search for motifs without user-defined parameters, SCOPE requires as input only a set of upstream sequences and a species designation, making it a practical choice for non-expert users. A user-friendly web interface, Java source code and executables are available at http://genie.dartmouth.edu/scope.},

abstract = {Changes in the patterns of gene expression are widely believed to underlie many of the phenotypic differences within and between species. Although much emphasis has been placed on changes in transcriptional regulation, gene expression is regulated at many levels, all of which must ultimately be studied together to obtain a complete picture of the evolution of gene expression. Here we compare the evolution of transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional regulation that is mediated by microRNAs, a large class of small, non-coding RNAs in plants and animals, focusing on the evolution of the individual regulators and their binding sites. As an initial step towards integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, we propose a simple model that describes the transcriptional regulation of new microRNA genes.},

abstract = {In the mosquito Aedes aegypti, the expression of two fat body genes involved in lipid metabolism, a lipid carrier protein lipophorin (Lp) and its lipophorin receptor (LpRfb), was significantly increased after infections with Gram (+) bacteria and fungi, but not with Gram (-) bacteria. The expression of these genes was enhanced after the infection with Plasmodium gallinaceum. RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of Lp strongly restricted the development of Plasmodium oocysts, reducing their number by 90\%. In Vg-DeltaREL1-A transgenic mosquitoes, with gain-of-function phenotype of Toll/REL1 immune pathway activated after blood feeding, both the Lp and LpRfb genes were overexpressed independently of septic injury. The same phenotype was observed in the mosquitoes with RNAi knockdown of Cactus, an IkappaB inhibitor in the Toll/REL1 pathway. These results showed that, in the mosquito fat body, both Lp and LpRfb gene expression were regulated by the Toll/REL1 pathway during immune induction by pathogen and parasite infections. Indeed, the proximal region of the LpRfb promoter contained closely linked binding motifs for GATA and NF-kappaB transcription factors. Transfection and in vivo RNAi knockdown experiments showed that the bindings of both GATA and NF-kappaB transcription factors to the corresponding motif were required for the induction of the LpRfb gene. These findings suggest that lipid metabolism is involved in the mosquito systemic immune responses to pathogens and parasites.},

abstract = {Vitellogenin receptor (VgR) is responsible for the receptor-mediated endocytosis of vitellogenin (Vg) in the egg formation of an oviparous animal, including insects. Little is known about regulation of VgR gene expression. We analyzed the upstream region of the VgR gene from Aedes aegypti (AaVgR) to identify regulatory elements responsible for its expression in germ cell-specific ovarian expression. Experiments with genetic transformation using the transgene containing the 1.5-Kb upstream portion of the AaVgR gene fused with DsRed and the piggyBac vector showed that this regulatory region is sufficient for correct female and ovary-specific expression of the transgene. This 1.5-Kb upstream region contained binding sites for the ecdysone regulatory hierarchy early gene products E74 and BR-C, as well as transcription factors determining correct tissue- and stage-specific expression of GATA and HNF3/fkh. In situ hybridization demonstrated that in the ovaries of transgenic females DsRed mRNA was present in ovarian germ cells and nurse cells of mature ovarian follicles, together with VgR mRNA. In contrast, DsRed mRNA was absent in the oocyte that had a high level of endogenous VgR mRNA. Although the 1.5-Kb upstream region was sufficient to drive a high-level germ line cell-specific expression of the reporter, additional signals were required for translocation of exogenous mRNA from nurse cells into the oocyte.},

The genomes of 12 Drosophila species, ten of which are presented here for the first time (sechellia, simulans, yakuba, erecta, ananassae, persimilis, willistoni, mojavensis, virilis and grimshawi), illustrate how rates and patterns of sequence divergence across taxa can illuminate evolutionary processes on a genomic scale. These genome sequences augment the formidable genetic tools that have made Drosophila melanogaster a pre-eminent model for animal genetics, and will further catalyse fundamental research on mechanisms of development, cell biology, genetics, disease, neurobiology, behaviour, physiology and evolution. Despite remarkable similarities among these Drosophila species, we identified many putatively non-neutral changes in protein-coding genes, non-coding RNA genes, and cis-regulatory regions. These may prove to underlie differences in the ecology and behaviour of these diverse species.},

abstract = {Correlation of motif occurrences with gene expression intensity is an effective strategy for elucidating transcriptional cis-regulatory logic. Here we demonstrate that this approach can also identify cis-regulatory elements for alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Using data from a human exon microarray, we identified 56 cassette exons that exhibited higher transcript-normalized expression in muscle than in other normal adult tissues. Intron sequences flanking these exons were then analyzed to identify candidate regulatory motifs for muscle-specific alternative splicing. Correlation of motif parameters with gene-normalized exon expression levels was examined using linear regression and linear splines on RNA words and degenerate weight matrices, respectively. Our unbiased analysis uncovered multiple candidate regulatory motifs for muscle-specific splicing, many of which are phylogenetically conserved among vertebrate genomes. The most prominent downstream motifs were binding sites for Fox1- and CELF-related splicing factors, and a branchpoint-like element acuaac; pyrimidine-rich elements resembling PTB-binding sites were most significant in upstream introns. Intriguingly, our systematic study indicates a paucity of novel muscle-specific elements that are dominant in short proximal intronic regions. We propose that Fox and CELF proteins play major roles in enforcing the muscle-specific alternative splicing program, facilitating expression of unique isoforms of cytoskeletal proteins critical to muscle cell function.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The completed sequence of the Anopheles gambiae genome has enabled genome-wide analyses of gene expression and regulation in this principal vector of human malaria. These investigations have created a demand for efficient methods of cataloguing and analyzing the large quantities of data that have been produced. The organization of genome-wide data into one unified database makes possible the efficient identification of spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, and by pairing these findings with comparative algorithms, may offer a tool to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that regulate these expression patterns. DESCRIPTION: We provide a publicly-accessible database and integrated data-mining tool, angaGEDUCI, that unifies 1) stage- and tissue-specific microarray analyses of gene expression in An. gambiae at different developmental stages and temporal separations following a bloodmeal, 2) functional gene annotation, 3) genomic sequence data, and 4) promoter sequence comparison algorithms. The database can be used to study genes expressed in particular stages, tissues, and patterns of interest, and to identify conserved promoter sequence motifs that may play a role in the regulation of such expression. The database is accessible from the address http://www.angaged.bio.uci.edu. CONCLUSION: By combining gene expression, function, and sequence data with integrated sequence comparison algorithms, angaGEDUCI streamlines spatial and temporal pattern-finding and produces a straightforward means of developing predictions and designing experiments to assess how gene expression may be controlled at the molecular level.},

abstract = {In the fat body of insects with cyclic egg maturation, lysosomes play a critical role in the termination of vitellogenesis by selectively degrading the secretory machinery involved in the massive production of yolk protein precursors. To investigate this fat body-specific lysosomal activity in the mosquito, a cathepsin D-like aspartic protease (LAP) was previously purified and its cDNA cloned. Here we report the isolation of the AaLAP gene from an Aedes aegypti genomic library. The transcribed region of the gene is comprised of five exons, spanning 1904 base pairs. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and genomic clone analyses show this gene to be single copy and polymorphic. Primer extension analysis revealed two putative transcription start sites (TSS). The extension products corresponding to the distal and proximal TSSs were present in both pre- and vitellogenic fat bodies, suggesting that both TSSs are involved in housekeeping as well as tissue-specific expression of this gene. TATA box-like and arthropod initiator sequences, hallmarks of regulated genes, were present near each putative TSS. Several sequences resembling binding sites for liver- and fat body-specific transcription factors were identified within 1 kb upstream and downstream of the gene. Significantly, direct binding for the C/EBP and GATA families of transcription factors was demonstrated in vitro by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Three sequences located upstream of AaLAP resembled the Drosophila melanogaster yolk protein fat body enhancer (Dm Yp FBE). Potential hormone-response elements were also recognized in the gene; however, they did not bind the mosquito ecdysteroid receptor/Ultraspiracle heterodimer in EMSA experiments, indicating that these sequences may interact with different nuclear receptors.},

@article{Enright2003,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recent discoveries of microRNA (miRNA) genes and characterization of the first few target genes regulated by miRNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have set the stage for elucidation of a novel network of regulatory control. We present a computational method for whole-genome prediction of miRNA target genes. The method is validated using known examples. For each miRNA, target genes are selected on the basis of three properties: sequence complementarity using a position-weighted local alignment algorithm, free energies of RNA-RNA duplexes, and conservation of target sites in related genomes. Application to the D. melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura and Anopheles gambiae genomes identifies several hundred target genes potentially regulated by one or more known miRNAs. RESULTS: These potential targets are rich in genes that are expressed at specific developmental stages and that are involved in cell fate specification, morphogenesis and the coordination of developmental processes, as well as genes that are active in the mature nervous system. High-ranking target genes are enriched in transcription factors two-fold and include genes already known to be under translational regulation. Our results reaffirm the thesis that miRNAs have an important role in establishing the complex spatial and temporal patterns of gene activity necessary for the orderly progression of development and suggest additional roles in the function of the mature organism. In addition the results point the way to directed experiments to determine miRNA functions. CONCLUSIONS: The emerging combinatorics of miRNA target sites in the 3' untranslated regions of messenger RNAs are reminiscent of transcriptional regulation in promoter regions of DNA, with both one-to-many and many-to-one relationships between regulator and target. Typically, more than one miRNA regulates one message, indicative of cooperative translational control. Conversely, one miRNA may have several target genes, reflecting target multiplicity. As a guide to focused experiments, we provide detailed online information about likely target genes and binding sites in their untranslated regions, organized by miRNA or by gene and ranked by likelihood of match. The target prediction algorithm is freely available and can be applied to whole genome sequences using identified miRNA sequences.},

abstract = {Analyses of integration of two-hormone signaling through the vertebrate nuclear hormone receptors, for which the retinoid X receptor is one partner, have generated a number of mechanistic models, including those described as 'subordination' models wherein ligand-activation of one partner is subordinate to the liganded state of the other partner. However, mechanisms by which two-hormone signaling is integrated through invertebrate nuclear hormone-binding receptors has not been heretofore experimentally elucidated. This report investigates the integration of signaling of invertebrate juvenile hormone (JH) and 20-OH ecdysone (20OHE) at the level of identified nuclear receptors (ultraspiracle and ecdysone receptor), which transcriptionally activate a defined model core promoter (JH esterase gene), through specified hormone response elements (DR1 and IR1). Application of JH III, or 20OHE, to cultured Sf9 cells transfected with a DR1JHECoreLuciferase (or IR1JHECoreLuciferase) reporter promoter each induced expression of the reporter. Cotreatment of transfected cells with both hormones yielded a greater than additive effect on transcription, for especially the IR1JHECoreLuciferase reporter. Overexpression in Sf9 cells of recombinant Drosophila melanogaster ultraspiracle (dUSP) fostered formation of dUSP oligomer (potentially homodimer), as measured by coimmunoprecipitation assay and electrophoretic mobility assay (EMSA) on a DR1 probe, and also increased the level of transcription in response to JH III, but did not increase the transcriptional response to either 20OHE treatment alone or to the two hormones together. Inapposite, overexpression of recombinant D. melanogaster ecdysone receptor (dEcR) in the transfected cells generated dUSP/dEcR heterodimer [as measured by EMSA (supershift) on a DR1 probe] and increased the transcriptional response to 20OHE-alone treatment, but did not increase the transcriptional response to the JH III-alone treatment. Our studies provide evidence that in this model system, JH III-activation of the reporter promoter is through USP oligomer (homodimer) that does not contain EcR, while the 20OHE-activation is through the USP/EcR heterodimer. These results also show that the integration of JH III and 20OHE signaling is through the USP/EcR heterodimer, but that when the EcR partner is unliganded, the USP partner in this system is unable to transduce the JH III-activation.},

abstract = {A full-length mosquito dopachrome conversion enzyme (DCE) and its truncated form lacking the last 54 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues are expressed using a baculovirus/insect cell expression system. The full-length recombinant DCE displayed multiple bands during native PAGE with substrate staining, but only one active band was detected when the truncated recombinant DCE was analyzed under identical analysis conditions. Our data suggest that the last 50 some carboxyl-terminal residues are involved in the polymerization of the DCE molecules and that the proposed DCE isozymes likely reflect the presence of multimers of the same DCE molecules. The significance of the recombinant DCE in accelerating the melanization pathway is demonstrated by a rapid production of melanin in a dopa and tyrosinase reaction mixture in the presence of recombinant DCE. The DCE sequence data obtained in our previous study, together with results of functional expression and biochemical characterization achieved in this study, provide a necessary reference for the study of other insect DCEs.},

Only 105 bp of proximal MT-IG 5'-flanking sequence containing a TATA box, two metal responsive elements (MREs), and three GC motifs and 147 bp of proximal MT-IF 5'-flanking sequence containing a TATCA box, four MREs, and two GC motifs were required for heavy metal-inducible expression. However, the proximal 111 bp of MT-IF 5'-flanking sequences (a TATCA box, two MREs, and two GC motifs) was not responsive to heavy metals and competes less efficiently than the 105-bp MT-IG fragment in a competition transfection analysis. The MT-IF promoter fragment containing MREc and MREd is substantially stronger and a more efficient competitor than the MT-IG promoter fragment containing MREc and MREd. Furthermore, the proximal 160 bp of MT-IG 5'-flanking sequence functions as a strong metal-inducible promoter but not as a metal-inducible enhancer. Mobility shift analysis of MT-IF and MT-IG promoter subregions suggests a correlation between protein binding to MRE sequences and MT gene expression. These data illustrate that the overall structural and functional organization of the MT-IF and MT-IG promoters are very different and that the molecular mechanisms governing differential expression levels of human MT genes are quite complex.},

@article{Fu2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data clustering analysis has been extensively applied to extract information from gene expression profiles obtained with DNA microarrays. To this aim, existing clustering approaches, mainly developed in computer science, have been adapted to microarray data analysis. However, previous studies revealed that microarray datasets have very diverse structures, some of which may not be correctly captured by current clustering methods. We therefore approached the problem from a new starting point, and developed a clustering algorithm designed to capture dataset-specific structures at the beginning of the process. RESULTS: The clustering algorithm is named Fuzzy clustering by Local Approximation of MEmbership (FLAME). Distinctive elements of FLAME are: (i) definition of the neighborhood of each object (gene or sample) and identification of objects with "archetypal" features named Cluster Supporting Objects, around which to construct the clusters; (ii) assignment to each object of a fuzzy membership vector approximated from the memberships of its neighboring objects, by an iterative converging process in which membership spreads from the Cluster Supporting Objects through their neighbors. Comparative analysis with K-means, hierarchical, fuzzy C-means and fuzzy self-organizing maps (SOM) showed that data partitions generated by FLAME are not superimposable to those of other methods and, although different types of datasets are better partitioned by different algorithms, FLAME displays the best overall performance. FLAME is implemented, together with all the above-mentioned algorithms, in a C++ software with graphical interface for Linux and Windows, capable of handling very large datasets, named Gene Expression Data Analysis Studio (GEDAS), freely available under GNU General Public License. CONCLUSION: The FLAME algorithm has intrinsic advantages, such as the ability to capture non-linear relationships and non-globular clusters, the automated definition of the number of clusters, and the identification of cluster outliers, i.e. genes that are not assigned to any cluster. As a result, clusters are more internally homogeneous and more diverse from each other, and provide better partitioning of biological functions. The clustering algorithm can be easily extended to applications different from gene expression analysis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experimental investigation of transcription is still a very labor- and time-consuming process. Only a few transcription initiation scenarios have been studied in detail. The mechanism of interaction between basal machinery and promoter, in particular core promoter elements, is not known for the majority of identified promoters. In this study, we reveal various transcription initiation mechanisms by statistical analysis of 3393 nonredundant Drosophila promoters. RESULTS: Using Drosophila-specific position-weight matrices, we identified promoters containing TATA box, Initiator, Downstream Promoter Element (DPE), and Motif Ten Element (MTE), as well as core elements discovered in Human (TFIIB Recognition Element (BRE) and Downstream Core Element (DCE)). Promoters utilizing known synergetic combinations of two core elements (TATA\_Inr, Inr\_MTE, Inr\_DPE, and DPE\_MTE) were identified. We also establish the existence of promoters with potentially novel synergetic combinations: TATA\_DPE and TATA\_MTE. Our analysis revealed several motifs with the features of promoter elements, including possible novel core promoter element(s). Comparison of Human and Drosophila showed consistent percentages of promoters with TATA, Inr, DPE, and synergetic combinations thereof, as well as most of the same functional and mutual positions of the core elements. No statistical evidence of MTE utilization in Human was found. Distinct nucleosome positioning in particular promoter classes was revealed. CONCLUSION: We present lists of promoters that potentially utilize the aforementioned elements/combinations. The number of these promoters is two orders of magnitude larger than the number of promoters in which transcription initiation was experimentally studied. The sequences are ready to be experimentally tested or used for further statistical analysis. The developed approach may be utilized for other species.},

abstract = {A high-resolution time series of transcript abundance was generated to describe global expression dynamics in response to nutrition in Drosophila. Nonparametric change-point statistics revealed that within 7 h of feeding upon yeast, transcript levels changed significantly for approximately 3,500 genes or 20\% of the Drosophila genome. Differences as small as 15\% were highly significant, and 80\% of the changes were <1.5-fold. Notably, transcript changes reflected rapid downregulation of the nutrient-sensing insulin and target of rapamycin pathways, shifting of fuel metabolism from lipid to glucose oxidation, and increased purine synthesis, TCA-biosynthetic functions and mitochondria biogenesis. To investigate how nutrition coordinates these transcriptional changes, feeding-induced expression changes were compared with those induced by the insulin-regulated transcription factor dFOXO in Drosophila S2 cells. Remarkably, 28\% (995) of the nutrient-responsive genes were regulated by activated dFOXO, including genes of mitochondrial biogenesis and a novel homolog of mammalian peroxisome proliferator-gamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1), a transcriptional coactivator implicated in controlling mitochondrial gene expression in mammals. These data implicate dFOXO as a major coordinator of the transcriptional response to nutrients downstream of insulin and suggest that mitochondria biogenesis is linked to insulin signaling via dFOXO-mediated repression of a PGC-1 homolog.},

abstract = {The Anopheles gambiae trypsin family consists of seven genes that are transcribed in the gut of female mosquitoes in a temporal coordinated and mutually exclusive manner, suggesting the involvement of a complex transcription regulatory mechanism. We identified a highly conserved 12-nucleotide motif present in all A. gambiae and Anopheles stephensi trypsin promoters. We investigated the role of this putative trypsin regulatory element (PTRE) in controlling the transcription of the trypsin genes. Gel shift experiments demonstrated that nuclear proteins of A. gambiae cell lines formed two distinct complexes with probes encompassing the PTRE sequence. Mapping of the binding sites revealed that one of the complex has the specificity of a GATA transcription factor. Promoter constructs containing mutations in the PTRE sequence that selectively abolished the binding of either one or both complexes exerted opposite effects on the transcriptional activity of trypsin promoters in A. gambiae and Aedes aegypti cell lines. In addition, the expression of a novel GATA gene was highly enriched in A. gambiae guts. Taken together our data prove that factors binding to the PTRE region are key regulatory elements possibly involved in the blood meal-induced repression and activation of transcription in early and late trypsin genes.},

Secretion reached a maximum 16 hr after a blood meal as shown by bioassay and direct determination. Ovariectomy reduced the concentration of ecdysone in the adult after a blood meal. Qualitative analysis of whole-body extracts indicated beta-ecdysone to be the principal species present. Thus the ovaries appear to secrete a prohormone, alpha-ecdysone, which is converted to beta-ecdysone. Beta-ecdysone plays a significant role in stimulating egg development in the adult mosquito and may have reproductive roles in other insects.},

We describe here a successful computational search for elements that direct expression in a particular temporal-spatial pattern in the Drosophila embryo, based on a single well characterized enhancer model. The fly genome was searched to identify sequence elements containing the same combination of transcription factors as those found in the model. Experimental evaluation of the search results demonstrates that our method can correctly predict regulatory elements and highlights the importance of functional testing as a means of identifying false-positive results. We also show that the search results enable the identification of additional relevant sequence motifs whose functions can be empirically validated. This approach, combined with gene expression and phylogenetic sequence data, allows for genome-wide identification of related regulatory elements, an important step toward understanding the genetic regulatory networks involved in development.},

abstract = {The study of gene function often requires changing the expression of a gene and evaluating the consequences. In principle, the expression of any given gene can be modulated in a quasi-continuum of discrete expression levels but the traditional approaches are usually limited to two extremes: gene knockout and strong overexpression. However, applications such as metabolic optimization and control analysis necessitate a continuous set of expression levels with only slight increments in strength to cover a specific window around the wild-type expression level of the studied gene; this requirement can be met by using promoter libraries. This approach generally consists of inserting a library of promoters in front of the gene to be studied, whereby the individual promoters might deviate either in their spacer sequences or bear slight deviations from the consensus sequence of a vegetative promoter. Here, we describe the two different methods for obtaining promoter libraries and compare their applicability.},

abstract = {A series of models of malaria-mosquito-human interactions using the Lumped Age-Class technique of Gurney \& Nisbet are developed. The models explicitly include sub-adult mosquito dynamics and assume that population regulation occurs at the larval stage. A challenge for modelling mosquito dynamics in continuous time is that the insect has discrete life-history stages (egg, larva, pupa \& adult), the sub-adult stages of relatively fixed duration, which are subject to very different demographic rates. The Lumped Age-Class technique provides a natural way to treat this type of population structure. The resulting model, phrased as a system of delay-differential equations, is only slightly harder to analyse than traditional ordinary differential equations and much easier than the alternative partial differential equation approach. The Lumped Age-Class technique also allows the natural treatment of the relatively fixed time delay between the mosquito ingesting Plasmodium and it becoming infective. Three models are developed to illustrate the application of this approach: one including just the mosquito dynamics, the second including Plasmodium but no human dynamics, and the third including the interaction of the malaria pathogen and the human population (though only in a simple classical Ross-Macdonald manner). A range of epidemiological quantities used in studying malaria such as the vectorial capacity, the entomological inoculation rate and the basic reproductive number (R0) are derived, and examples given of the analysis and simulation of model dynamics. Assumptions and extensions are discussed. It is suggested that this modelling framework may be a natural and useful tool for exploring a variety of issues in malaria-vector epidemiology, especially in circumstances where a dynamic representation of mosquito recruitment is required.},

In this study we aimed to identify Fox factors that are expressed within the fat body of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti, and determine whether any of these are involved in the regulation of mosquito yolk protein gene expression. The Ae. aegypti genome contains 18 loci that encode putative Fox factors. Our stringent cladistic analysis has profound implications for the use of Fox genes as phylogenetic markers. Twelve Ae. aegypti Fox genes are expressed within various tissues of adult females, six of which are expressed within the fat body. All six Fox genes expressed in the fat body displayed dynamic expression profiles following a blood meal. We knocked down the 'fat body Foxes' through RNAi to determine whether these 'knockdowns' hindered amino acid-induced vitellogenin gene expression. We also determined the effect of these knockdowns on the number of eggs deposited following a blood meal. Knockdown of FoxN1, FoxN2, FoxL, and FoxO, had a negative effect on amino acid-induced vitellogenin gene expression and resulted in significantly fewer eggs laid. Our analysis stresses the importance of Fox transcription factors in regulating mosquito reproduction.},

Co-amplification of two esterase genes, estalpha2(1) and estbeta2(1), is the most common resistance genotype. In both resistant and susceptible mosquitoes the alpha- and beta-esterase genes are oriented in a head-to-head arrangement, the intergenic sequences containing promoter elements for the divergent transcription of both esterases. Transient transfection of luciferase reporter gene constructs into a C. quinquefasciatus cell line was used to study these promoters. A control vector was constructed with the strong Drosophila actin 5c promoter driving expression of beta-galactosidase. The beta-esterase promoters from both insecticide resistant and -susceptible insects were highly active in directing luciferase expression. Transfections with panels of deletions revealed several regions where binding sites for positive and negative regulatory elements are located, and candidate transcription factor sites have been identified. Gel shift assays have identified one DNA-protein interaction that is stronger with the resistant than with the equivalent but slightly altered susceptible sequence. The arthropod initiator site TCAGT 135bp upstream of the ATG in both beta-esterase promoters is essential for transcription initiation, but a putative TATA box is not involved.},

Macrophage-specific synthetic promoters (SPs) generated by random ligation of myeloid/macrophage cis elements had activity up to 100-fold that of a native macrophage promoter in macrophage cell lines, but were minimally active in nonmyeloid cells. Mouse bone marrow cells (BMCs) transduced ex vivo with lentivectors expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven either by an SP (SP-GFP) or a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (CMV-GFP) were used for syngeneic transplantation of lethally irradiated mice. Blood leukocytes showed stable GFP expression for up to 15 months after transplantation. SP-GFP expression was selective for CD11b+ macrophages, whereas CMV-GFP expression was observed in erythrocytes, as well as in both CD11b+ and CD11b- leukocytes. Furthermore, SP-GFP expression was much stronger than CMV-GFP expression in CD11b+ macrophages. apoE-/- BMCs transduced with the lentiviral vector encoding human apoE were used to transplant apoE-/- mice. Macrophage expression of apoE from 10 to 26 weeks of age significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesions in recipient apoE-/- mice. Thus, the novel SPs, especially when combined with lentivectors, are useful for macrophage-specific delivery of therapeutic genes.},

Although this cell line has previously been shown to synthesize components of the ecdysteroid receptor and ecdysone-inducible proteins, the well-characterized ecdysteroid response element (EcRE) from the Drosophilahsp27 promoter failed to confer a substantial 20-hydroxyecdysone mediated induction in transfected mosquito cells. Recovery of stably transformed clones was also reduced in a DNA dependent manner when the EcREs were in the sense orientation, relative to control plasmids lacking the EcREs or containing an antisense construct. Finally, when tandem EcREs were placed within the hsp70 promoter, CAT activity was detected only after prolonged enzyme incubation, suggesting that the DNA interfered with cellular metabolism. In these constructs, we noted that the promoter DNA contained several potential binding sites for the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor, one of which lay between the tandem EcREs. On southwestern blots, a 40 kDa nuclear protein from C7-10 cells bound to DNA containing AP-1 sites. A DNA affinity column was used to partially purify the 40 kDa protein, and western analysis showed that the mosquito protein cross-reacted with a heterologous antibody to JUN. Likewise, mRNA from C7-10 cells cross-hybridized with the jun cDNA from Drosophila. These results suggest that like estrogen, 20-hydroxyecdysone interfaces with AP-1 as a co-activator protein that modulates the overall hormone response.},

abstract = {In this article, we review some of the expression systems that are available for Metabolic Control Analysis and Metabolic Engineering, and examine their advantages and disadvantages in different contexts. In a recent approach, artificial promoters for modulating gene expression in micro-organisms were constructed using synthetic degenerated oligonucleotides. From this work, a promoter library was obtained for Lactococcus lactis, containing numerous individual promoters and covering a wide range of promoter activities. Importantly, the range of promoter activities was covered in small steps of activity change. Promoter libraries generated by this approach allow for optimization of gene expression and for experimental control analysis in a wide range of biological systems by choosing from the promoter library promoters giving, e.g., 25\%, 50\%, 200\%, and 400\% of the normal expression level of the gene in question. If the relevant variable (e.g., the flux or yield) is then measured with each of these constructs, then one can calculate the control coefficient and determine the optimal expression level. One advantage of the method is that the construct which is found to have the optimal expression level is then, in principle, ready for use in the industrial fermentation process; another advantage is that the system can be used to optimize the expression of different enzymes within the same cell.},

@article{Junger2003,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Forkhead transcription factors belonging to the FOXO subfamily are negatively regulated by protein kinase B (PKB) in response to signaling by insulin and insulin-like growth factor in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals. In Drosophila, the insulin-signaling pathway regulates the size of cells, organs, and the entire body in response to nutrient availability, by controlling both cell size and cell number. In this study, we present a genetic characterization of dFOXO, the only Drosophila FOXO ortholog. RESULTS: Ectopic expression of dFOXO and human FOXO3a induced organ-size reduction and cell death in a manner dependent on phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase and nutrient levels. Surprisingly, flies homozygous for dFOXO null alleles are viable and of normal size. They are, however, more sensitive to oxidative stress. Furthermore, dFOXO function is required for growth inhibition associated with reduced insulin signaling. Loss of dFOXO suppresses the reduction in cell number but not the cell-size reduction elicited by mutations in the insulin-signaling pathway. By microarray analysis and subsequent genetic validation, we have identified d4E-BP, which encodes a translation inhibitor, as a relevant dFOXO target gene. CONCLUSION: Our results show that dFOXO is a crucial mediator of insulin signaling in Drosophila, mediating the reduction in cell number in insulin-signaling mutants. We propose that in response to cellular stresses, such as nutrient deprivation or increased levels of reactive oxygen species, dFOXO is activated and inhibits growth through the action of target genes such as d4E-BP.},

We cross-validate our predictions on 31 regulatory networks in Drosophila and through correlations with gene expression data. Five predicted modules tested using an in vivo reporter gene assay all show tissue-specific regulatory activity. We also demonstrate our methods' ability to predict mammalian tissue-specific enhancers. Finally, we predict human CRMs that regulate early blood and cardiovascular development. In vivo transgenic mouse analysis of two predicted CRMs demonstrates that both have appropriate enhancer activity. Overall, 7/7 predictions were validated successfully in vivo, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for insect and mammalian genomes.},

abstract = {We cloned three isoforms of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4) from the mosquito Aedes aegypti, designated AaHNF-4a, AaHNF-4b, and AaHNF-4c. AaHNF-4a and AaHNF-4b are typical members of the HNF-4 subfamily of nuclear receptors with high amino acid conservation. They differ in N-terminal regions and exhibit distinct developmental profiles in the female mosquito fat body, a metabolic tissue functionally analogous to the vertebrate liver. The AaHNF-4b mRNA is predominant during the previtellogenic and vitellogenic phases, while the AaHNF-4a mRNA is predominant during the termination phase of vitellogenesis, coinciding with the onset of lipogenesis. The third isoform, AaHNF-4c, lacks part of the A/B and the entire C (DNA-binding) domains. The AaHNF-4c transcript found in the fat body during the termination of vitellogenesis may serve as a transcriptional inhibitor. Both AaHNF-4a and AaHNF-4b bind to the cognate DNA recognition site in electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Dimerization of AaHNF-4c with other mosquito HNF-4 isoforms or with mammalian HNF-4 prevents binding to the HNF-4 response element. In transfected human 293T cells, AaHNF-4c significantly reduced the transactivating effect of the human HNF-4alpha1 on the apolipoprotein CIII promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed the presence of HNF-4 binding sites upstream of A. aegypti vg and vcp, two yolk protein genes expressed in the female mosquito fat body during vitellogenesis. Therefore, HNF-4, an important regulator of liver-specific genes, plays a critical role in the insect fat body.},

@article{Kim2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: A complete understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression is the next important issue of genomics. Many bioinformaticians have developed methods and algorithms for predicting transcriptional regulatory mechanisms from sequence, gene expression, and binding data. However, most of these studies involved the use of yeast which has much simpler regulatory networks than human and has many genome wide binding data and gene expression data under diverse conditions. Studies of genome wide transcriptional networks of human genomes currently lag behind those of yeast. RESULTS: We report herein a new method that combines gene expression data analysis with promoter analysis to infer transcriptional regulatory elements of human genes. The Z scores from the application of gene set analysis with gene sets of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) were successfully used to represent the activity of TFBSs in a given microarray data set. A significant correlation between the Z scores of gene sets of TFBSs and individual genes across multiple conditions permitted successful identification of many known human transcriptional regulatory elements of genes as well as the prediction of numerous putative TFBSs of many genes which will constitute a good starting point for further experiments. Using Z scores of gene sets of TFBSs produced better predictions than the use of mRNA levels of a transcription factor itself, suggesting that the Z scores of gene sets of TFBSs better represent diverse mechanisms for changing the activity of transcription factors in the cell. In addition, cis-regulatory modules, combinations of co-acting TFBSs, were readily identified by our analysis. CONCLUSION: By a strategic combination of gene set level analysis of gene expression data sets and promoter analysis, we were able to identify and predict many transcriptional regulatory elements of human genes. We conclude that this approach will aid in decoding some of the important transcriptional regulatory elements of human genes.},

abstract = {Virtually no information regarding timing of deep lineage divergences within mosquito family (Culicidae) exists, which poses an important problem in the postgenomic era. To address this issue, the complete 15,354 bp mitochondrial genome of Anopheles funestus was assembled from both mtDNA and cDNA sequences generated from transcripts of the mtDNA-encoded protein and rRNA genes. Analysis of the transcript information allowed an improved genome annotation, revealing that the translation initiation codon for the cox1 gene is TCG, rather than atypical, longer codons proposed in several other insects. The 5'ends of nad1 and nad5 transcripts begin with TTG and GTG triplets, respectively, which apparently serve as the translation initiators for those genes. We used all the A. funestus mtDNA gene sequences and three other publicly available mosquito mtDNA genomes for the estimation of divergence time points within Culicidae. The maximum likelihood date estimates for the splits between Anopheles and Aedes (approximately 145-200 Mya), between Anopheles subgenera Cellia and Anopheles (approximately 90-106 Mya), and between lineages within subgenus Anopheles (approximately 70-85 Mya) inferred from protein-coding genes are roughly twice as high as the dates based on RNA gene sequences. Although existing evidence does not unequivocally favor one of the alternatives, fossil-based predictions of the age of the family Culicidae are in better agreement with dates inferred from protein-coding genes.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: RNA-Seq is a promising new technology for accurately measuring gene expression levels. Expression estimation with RNA-Seq requires the mapping of relatively short sequencing reads to a reference genome or transcript set. Because reads are generally shorter than transcripts from which they are derived, a single read may map to multiple genes and isoforms, complicating expression analyses. Previous computational methods either discard reads that map to multiple locations or allocate them to genes heuristically. RESULTS: We present a generative statistical model and associated inference methods that handle read mapping uncertainty in a principled manner. Through simulations parameterized by real RNA-Seq data, we show that our method is more accurate than previous methods. Our improved accuracy is the result of handling read mapping uncertainty with a statistical model and the estimation of gene expression levels as the sum of isoform expression levels. Unlike previous methods, our method is capable of modeling non-uniform read distributions. Simulations with our method indicate that a read length of 20-25 bases is optimal for gene-level expression estimation from mouse and maize RNA-Seq data when sequencing throughput is fixed.},

abstract = {Recently, we performed an assessment of 13 popular computational tools for discovery of transcription factor binding sites (M. Tompa, N. Li, et al., "Assessing Computational Tools for the Discovery of Transcription Factor Binding Sites", Nature Biotechnology, Jan. 2005). This paper contains follow-up analysis of the assessment results, and raises and discusses some important issues concerning the state of the art in motif discovery methods: 1. We categorize the objective functions used by existing tools, and design experiments to evaluate whether any of these objective functions is the right one to optimize. 2. We examine various features of the data sets that were used in the assessment, such as sequence length and motif degeneracy, and identify which features make data sets hard for current motif discovery tools. 3. We identify an important feature that has not yet been used by existing tools and propose a new objective function that incorporates this feature.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of gene regulators whose biogenesis involves hairpin structures called precursor miRNAs, or pre-miRNAs. A pre-miRNA is processed to make a miRNA:miRNA* duplex, which is then separated to generate a mature miRNA and a miRNA*. The mature miRNAs play key regulatory roles during embryonic development as well as other cellular processes. They are also implicated in control of viral infection as well as innate immunity. Direct experimental evidence for mosquito miRNAs has been recently reported in anopheline mosquitoes based on small-scale cloning efforts. RESULTS: We obtained approximately 130, 000 small RNA sequences from the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, by 454 sequencing of samples that were isolated from mixed-age embryos and midguts from sugar-fed and blood-fed females, respectively. We also performed bioinformatics analysis on the Ae. aegypti genome assembly to identify evidence for additional miRNAs. The combination of these approaches uncovered 98 different pre-miRNAs in Ae. aegypti which could produce 86 distinct miRNAs. Thirteen miRNAs, including eight novel miRNAs identified in this study, are currently only found in mosquitoes. We also identified five potential revisions to previously annotated miRNAs at the miRNA termini, two cases of highly abundant miRNA* sequences, 14 miRNA clusters, and 17 cases where more than one pre-miRNA hairpin produces the same or highly similar mature miRNAs. A number of miRNAs showed higher levels in midgut from blood-fed female than that from sugar-fed female, which was confirmed by northern blots on two of these miRNAs. Northern blots also revealed several miRNAs that showed stage-specific expression. Detailed expression analysis of eight of the 13 mosquito-specific miRNAs in four divergent mosquito genera identified cases of clearly conserved expression patterns and obvious differences. Four of the 13 miRNAs are specific to certain lineage(s) within mosquitoes. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first systematic analysis of miRNAs in Ae. aegypti and offers a substantially expanded list of miRNAs for all mosquitoes. New insights were gained on the evolution of conserved and lineage-specific miRNAs in mosquitoes. The expression profiles of a few miRNAs suggest stage-specific functions and functions related to embryonic development or blood feeding. A better understanding of the functions of these miRNAs will offer new insights in mosquito biology and may lead to novel approaches to combat mosquito-borne infectious diseases.},

abstract = {During insect metamorphosis, each tissue displays a unique physiological and morphological response to the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (ecdysone). We assayed gene expression in five tissues during metamorphosis onset. Larval-specific tissues display major changes in genome-wide expression profiles, whereas tissues that survive into adulthood display few changes. In one larval tissue, the salivary gland, we used a computational approach to identify a regulatory motif and a cognate transcription factor involved in regulating a set of coexpressed genes. During the metamorphosis of another tissue, the midgut, genes encoding factors from the hedgehog, Notch, EGF, dpp, and wingless pathways are activated by the ecdysone regulatory network. Mutation of the ecdysone receptor abolishes their induction. Cell cycle genes are also activated during the initiation of midgut metamorphosis, and they are also dependent on ecdysone signaling. These results establish multiple new connections between the ecdysone regulatory network and other well-studied regulatory networks.},

abstract = {High-dimensional data sets generated by high-throughput technologies, such as DNA microarray, are often the outputs of complex networked systems driven by hidden regulatory signals. Traditional statistical methods for computing low-dimensional or hidden representations of these data sets, such as principal component analysis and independent component analysis, ignore the underlying network structures and provide decompositions based purely on a priori statistical constraints on the computed component signals. The resulting decomposition thus provides a phenomenological model for the observed data and does not necessarily contain physically or biologically meaningful signals. Here, we develop a method, called network component analysis, for uncovering hidden regulatory signals from outputs of networked systems, when only a partial knowledge of the underlying network topology is available. The a priori network structure information is first tested for compliance with a set of identifiability criteria. For networks that satisfy the criteria, the signals from the regulatory nodes and their strengths of influence on each output node can be faithfully reconstructed. This method is first validated experimentally by using the absorbance spectra of a network of various hemoglobin species. The method is then applied to microarray data generated from yeast Saccharamyces cerevisiae and the activities of various transcription factors during cell cycle are reconstructed by using recently discovered connectivity information for the underlying transcriptional regulatory networks.},

We applied smsDGE to the transcriptome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain DBY746, using 6 of the available 50 channels in a single sequencing run, yielding on average 12 million aligned reads per channel. Using spiked-in RNA, accurate quantitative measurements were obtained over four orders of magnitude. High correlation was demonstrated across independent flow-cell channels, instrument runs and sample preparations. Transcript counting in smsDGE is highly efficient due to the representation of each transcript molecule by a single read. This efficiency, coupled with the high throughput enabled by the single-molecule sequencing platform, provides an alternative method for expression profiling.},

abstract = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by cDNA microarray hybridization (ChIP-array) has become a popular procedure for studying genome-wide protein-DNA interactions and transcription regulation. However, it can only map the probable protein-DNA interaction loci within 1-2 kilobases resolution. To pinpoint interaction sites down to the base-pair level, we introduce a computational method, Motif Discovery scan (MDscan), that examines the ChIP-array-selected sequences and searches for DNA sequence motifs representing the protein-DNA interaction sites. MDscan combines the advantages of two widely adopted motif search strategies, word enumeration and position-specific weight matrix updating, and incorporates the ChIP-array ranking information to accelerate searches and enhance their success rates. MDscan correctly identified all the experimentally verified motifs from published ChIP-array experiments in yeast (STE12, GAL4, RAP1, SCB, MCB, MCM1, SFF, and SWI5), and predicted two motif patterns for the differential binding of Rap1 protein in telomere regions. In our studies, the method was faster and more accurate than several established motif-finding algorithms. MDscan can be used to find DNA motifs not only in ChIP-array experiments but also in other experiments in which a subgroup of the sequences can be inferred to contain relatively abundant motif sites. The MDscan web server can be accessed at http://BioProspector.stanford.edu/MDscan/.},

abstract = {In the female mosquito Aedes aegypti, trypsin expression is largely biphasic. Early trypsin synthesis, which is regulated at the translational level relative to feeding, peaks in the first few hours post-blood meal. Late trypsin expression is regulated at the transcriptional level, and peaks 18-24h post-blood meal. It was proposed that early trypsin activity released unknown factors during digestion of a meal that caused activation of transcription of the late trypsin gene. This connection between early trypsin activity and late trypsin expression was dependent on the fact that feeding a single trypsin inhibitor, soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI), which blocked early trypsin activity, also blocked late trypsin expression. We show in this study that feeding different trypsin inhibitors which effectively blocked early trypsin activity did not result in reduced late trypsin expression. We also found that a different lot of STI failed to cause inhibition of late trypsin transcription, although it was effective in inhibiting early trypsin activity. In addition, using RNAi methodology to reduce the level of early trypsin expression had no effect on the level of late trypsin expression. We conclude that early trypsin activity is not necessary for the transcriptional activation of late trypsin and that the previous results were due to the effect of a cytotoxic agent present in some, but not all preparations of STI.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the regulatory processes that coordinate the cascade of gene expression leading to male gamete development has proven challenging. Research has been hindered in part by an incomplete picture of the regulatory elements that are both characteristic of and distinctive to the broad population of spermatogenically expressed genes. DESCRIPTION: K-SPMM, a database of murine Spermatogenic Promoters Modules and Motifs, has been developed as a web-based resource for the comparative analysis of promoter regions and their constituent elements in developing male germ cells. The system contains data on 7,551 genes and 11,715 putative promoter regions in Sertoli cells, spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids. K-SPMM provides a detailed portrait of promoter site components, ranging from broad distributions of transcription factor binding sites to graphical illustrations of dimeric modules with respect to individual transcription start sites. Binding sites are identified through their similarities to position weight matrices catalogued in either the JASPAR or the TRANSFAC transcription factor archives. A flexible search function allows sub-populations of promoters to be identified on the basis of their presence in any of the four cell-types, their association with a list of genes or their component transcription-factor families. CONCLUSION: This system can now be used independently or in conjunction with other databases of gene expression as a powerful aid to research networks of co-regulation. We illustrate this with respect to the spermiogenically active protamine locus in which binding sites are predicted that align well with biologically foot-printed protein binding domains.

abstract = {Nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) are ubiquitous in living organisms. However, little is known about the evolution of this large gene family. The first inducible NOS to be described from an invertebrate regulates malaria parasite (Plasmodium spp.) development in the mosquito Anopheles stephensi. This single copy gene shows the highest homology to the vertebrate neuronal isoforms, followed by decreasing homology to endothelial and inducible isoforms. The open reading frame of 1247 amino acids is encoded by 19 exons, which span approximately 33 kilobases. More than 50\% of the mosquito exons, distributed around the putative heme, calmodulin, and FAD/NADPH cofactor-binding domains, are conserved with those of the three human genes. Repetitive elements identified within the larger introns include a polymorphic dinucleotide repeat, two tandem repeats, and a putative miniature inverted repeat transposable element. Sequence analysis and primer extension indicate that the upstream promoter is 'TATA-less' with multiple transcription start sites within approximately 250 base pairs of the initiation methionine. Transcription factor binding sites in the 5'-flanking sequence demonstrate a bipartite distribution of lipopolysaccharide- and inflammatory cytokine-responsive elements that is strikingly similar to that described for vertebrate inducible NOS gene promoters.},

The combinatorial interaction of these bound transcription factors determines time- and tissue-specific gene activation or repression. The even-skipped stripe 2 element controls the expression of the second transverse stripe of even-skipped messenger RNA in Drosophila melanogaster embryos, and is one of the best characterized eukaryotic enhancers. Although even-skipped stripe 2 expression is strongly conserved in Drosophila, the stripe 2 element itself has undergone considerable evolutionary change in its binding-site sequences and the spacing between them. We have investigated this apparent contradiction, and here we show that two chimaeric enhancers, constructed by swapping the 5' and 3' halves of the native stripe 2 elements of two species, no longer drive expression of a reporter gene in the wildtype pattern. Sequence differences between species have functional consequences, therefore, but they are masked by other co-evolved differences. On the basis of these results, we present a model for the evolution of eukaryotic regulatory sequences.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elucidating gene regulatory networks is crucial for understanding normal cell physiology and complex pathologic phenotypes. Existing computational methods for the genome-wide "reverse engineering" of such networks have been successful only for lower eukaryotes with simple genomes. Here we present ARACNE, a novel algorithm, using microarray expression profiles, specifically designed to scale up to the complexity of regulatory networks in mammalian cells, yet general enough to address a wider range of network deconvolution problems. This method uses an information theoretic approach to eliminate the majority of indirect interactions inferred by co-expression methods. RESULTS: We prove that ARACNE reconstructs the network exactly (asymptotically) if the effect of loops in the network topology is negligible, and we show that the algorithm works well in practice, even in the presence of numerous loops and complex topologies. We assess ARACNE's ability to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks using both a realistic synthetic dataset and a microarray dataset from human B cells. On synthetic datasets ARACNE achieves very low error rates and outperforms established methods, such as Relevance Networks and Bayesian Networks. Application to the deconvolution of genetic networks in human B cells demonstrates ARACNE's ability to infer validated transcriptional targets of the cMYC proto-oncogene. We also study the effects of misestimation of mutual information on network reconstruction, and show that algorithms based on mutual information ranking are more resilient to estimation errors. CONCLUSION: ARACNE shows promise in identifying direct transcriptional interactions in mammalian cellular networks, a problem that has challenged existing reverse engineering algorithms. This approach should enhance our ability to use microarray data to elucidate functional mechanisms that underlie cellular processes and to identify molecular targets of pharmacological compounds in mammalian cellular networks.},

abstract = {In the female mosquito Aedes aegypti, vitellogenin (Vg), the major YPP, is activated by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) at the transcriptional level. We used cell transfection assays in the Drosophila S2 cells to investigate whether 20E acts directly on the Vg gene via its functional receptor, the heterodimer composed of the ecdysteroid receptor (EcR) and the ultraspiracle (USP) proteins. We demonstrated that the Vg 5'-regulatory region contains a functional ecdysteroid-responsive element (VgEcRE1) that is necessary to confer responsiveness to 20E. VgEcRE binds directly to EcR-USP produced in vitro and extracted from the vitellogenic fat body nuclei. The binding intensity of the EcR-USP-EcRE1 complex from nuclear extracts corresponds to the levels of ecdysteroids and of the Vg transcript during the vitellogenic cycle. Given the modest level of 20E-dependent activation, it is likely that the EcR-USP receptor acts synergistically with other transcription factors to bring about the high level of Vg gene expression.},

Coupled with an analysis of clock mutant (Clk) flies, a cell line designed to identify direct targets of the CLOCK (CLK) transcription factor and differential display, we uncovered several striking features of circadian gene networks. These include the identification of 134 cycling genes, which contribute to a wide range of diverse processes. Many of these clock or clock-regulated genes are located in gene clusters, which appear subject to transcriptional coregulation. All oscillating gene expression is under clk control, indicating that Drosophila has no clk-independent circadian systems. An even larger number of genes is affected in Clk flies, suggesting that clk affects other genetic networks. As we identified a small number of direct target genes, the data suggest that most of the circadian gene network is indirectly regulated by clk.},

This stimulated activity depends upon a cluster of three NF-kappaB binding sites and closely associated C/EBP-like motifs, which function as a unit for optimal promoter activity. Binding of NF-kappaB and C/EBP like transcription factors is confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, including supershifts with antibodies to C/EBP. KappaB-like motifs are abundant within antimicrobial peptide gene promoters and most are very closely associated with putative C/EBP binding sites. This novel association between NF-kappaB and C/EBP binding sites may, therefore, be of widespread significance.},

abstract = {Gene expression domains are normally not arranged in vertebrate genomes according to their expression patterns. Instead, it is not unusual to find genes expressed in different cell types, or in different developmental stages, sharing a particular region of a chromosome. Therefore, the existence of boundaries, or insulators, as non-coding gene regulatory elements, is instrumental for the adequate organization and function of vertebrate genomes. Through the evolution and natural selection at the molecular level, and according to available DNA sequences surrounding a locus, previously existing or recently mobilized, different elements have been recruited to serve as boundaries, depending on their suitability to properly insulate gene expression domains. In this regard, several gene regulatory elements, including scaffold/matrix-attachment regions, members of families of DNA repetitive elements (such as LINEs or SINEs), target sites for the zinc-finger multipurpose nuclear factor CTCF, enhancers and locus control regions, have been reported to show functional activities as insulators. In this review, we will address how such a variety of apparently different genomic sequences converge in a similar function, namely, to adequately insulate a gene expression domain, thereby allowing the locus to be expressed according to their own gene regulatory elements without interfering itself and being interfered by surrounding loci. The identification and characterization of genomic boundaries is not only interesting as a theoretical exercise for better understanding how vertebrate genomes are organized, but also allows devising new and improved gene transfer strategies to ensure the expression of heterologous DNA constructs in ectopic genomic locations.},

Six independent transgenic lines were obtained with the AeCP construct and one with the AgCP construct. Luciferase mRNA and protein were abundantly expressed in the guts of transgenic mosquitoes in four of the six AeCP lines and in the AgCP line. Expression of the reporter gene was gut-specific and reached peak levels at about 24 h post-blood ingestion. The AeCP and AgCP promoters can be used to drive the expression of genes that hinder parasite development in the mosquito gut.},

abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are an abundant source of genetic variation among individual organisms. To assess the usefulness of SNPs for genome analysis in the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, we sequenced 25 nuclear genes in each of three strains and analysed nucleotide diversity. The average frequency of nucleotide variation was 12 SNPs per kilobase, indicating that nucleotide variation in Ae. aegypti is similar to that in other organisms, including Drosophila and the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. Transition polymorphisms outnumbered transversion polymorphisms, at a ratio of about 2:1. We examined codon usage and confirmed that mutational bias favours G and C ending codons. Codon bias was most pronounced in highly expressed genes. Nucleotide diversity estimates indicated that substitution rates are positively correlated in coding and non-coding regions. Nucleotide diversity varied from one gene to another. The unequal distribution of SNPs among Ae. aegypti nuclear genes suggests that single base variations are non-neutral and are subject to selective constraints. Our analysis showed that ubiquitously expressed genes have lower polymorphism rates and are likely under strong purifying selection, whereas tissue specific genes and genes with a putative role in parasite defence exhibit higher levels of polymorphism that may be associated with diversifying selection.},

abstract = {The molting process in arthropods is regulated by steroid hormones acting via nuclear receptor proteins. The most common molting hormone is the ecdysteroid, 20-hydroxyecdysone. The receptors of 20-hydroxyecdysone have also been identified in many arthropod species, and the amino acid sequences determined. The functional molting hormone receptors consist of two members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, namely the ecdysone receptor and the ultraspiracle, although the ecdysone receptor may be functional, in some instances, without the ultraspiracle. Generally, the ecdysone receptor/ultraspiracle heterodimer binds to a number of ecdysone response elements, sequence motifs that reside in the promoter of various ecdysteroid-responsive genes. In the ensuing transcriptional induction, the ecdysone receptor/ultraspiracle complex binds to 20-hydroxyecdysone or to a cognate ligand that, in turn, leads to the release of a corepressor and the recruitment of coactivators. 3D structures of the ligand-binding domains of the ecdysone receptor and the ultraspiracle have been solved for a few insect species. Ecdysone agonists bind to ecdysone receptors specifically, and ligand-ecdysone receptor binding is enhanced in the presence of the ultraspiracle in insects. The basic mode of ecdysteroid receptor action is highly conserved, but substantial functional differences exist among the receptors of individual species. Even though the transcriptional effects are apparently similar for ecdysteroids and nonsteroidal compounds such as diacylhydrazines, the binding shapes are different between them. The compounds having the strongest binding affinity to receptors ordinarily have strong molting hormone activity. The ability of the ecdysone receptor/ultraspiracle complex to manifest the effects of small lipophilic agonists has led to their use as gene switches for medical and agricultural applications.},

Effective vaccines against all four serotypes of Dengue are in development, but population replacement with transgenic vectors unable to transmit the virus might ultimately prove to be an effective approach to disease suppression, or even eradication. A key element of the refractory transgenic vector approach is the development of transgenes that effectively prohibit viral transmission. In this report we test the effectiveness of several hammerhead ribozymes for suppressing DENV in lentivirus-transduced mosquito cells in an attempt to mimic the transgenic use of these effector molecules in mosquitoes. A lentivirus vector that expresses these ribozymes as a fusion RNA molecule using an Ae. aegypti tRNA(val) promoter and terminating with a 60A tail insures optimal expression, localization, and activity of the hammerhead ribozyme against the DENV genome. Among the 14 hammerhead ribozymes we designed to attack the DENV-2 NGC genome, several appear to be relatively effective in reducing virus production from transduced cells by as much as 2 logs. Among the sequences targeted are 10 that are conserved among all DENV serotype 2 strains. Our results confirm that hammerhead ribozymes can be effective in suppressing DENV in a transgenic approach, and provide an alternative or supplementary approach to proposed siRNA strategies for DENV suppression in transgenic mosquitoes.},

abstract = {Understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling cardiac-specific gene transcription requires the dissection of the cis-elements that govern the complex spatio-temporal expression of these genes. The four-chambered vertebrate heart is formed during the late phases of fetal development following a series of complex morphogenetic events that require the functional presence of different proteins. The gradient-like expression of some genes, as well as the chamber-specific expression of others, is tightly regulated by combinatorial interactions of several transcription factors and their cofactors. Chamber- and stage-specific cardiac myocyte cultures have been invaluable for identifying transcription factor binding sites involved in basal, chamber-specific, and inducible expression of many cardiac promoters; these studies, which were largely confirmed in vivo in transgenic mouse models, led to the isolation of key regulators of heart development. In addition, the use of pluripotent embryonic stem cells helped elucidate the early molecular events controlling cardiomyocyte differentiation. Together, these studies point to a major role for GATA transcription factors and their interacting partners in transcriptional control of heart development. In addition, members of the T-box family of transcription factors and homeodomain containing proteins, together with chamber-restricted transcriptional repressors and co-repressors play critical roles in heart septation and chamber specification. These fine-tuned cooperative interactions between different classes of proteins are at the basis of normal cardiac function, and alteration in their expression level or function leads to cardiac pathologies.},

These reveal that a threshold parameter, the vectorial basic reproduction number, exist and the vector can established itself in the community if and only if this parameter exceeds unity. When a non-zero steady state population density exists, it can be stable but it can also be driven to instability via a Hopf Bifurcation to periodic solutions, as a parameter is varied in parameter space. By considering a special case, an asymptotic perturbation analysis is used to derive the amplitude of the oscillating solutions for the full non-linear system. The present modelling exercise and results show that it is possible to study the population dynamics of disease vectors, and hence oscillatory behaviour as it is often observed in most indirectly transmitted infectious diseases of humans, without recourse to external seasonal forcing.},

abstract = {NQO1 [NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1] has an integral role in cellular responses to oxidative stress. The expression of NQO1 is up-regulated in the mouse following challenge with electrophilic chemicals, in an Nrf2 (NF-E2 p45-related factor 2)-dependent fashion, but the molecular basis for this observation remains unexplained. Through characterization of the murine nqo1 5'-upstream region, we now show that Nrf2 regulates this gene directly via an ARE (antioxidant response element) that lies within a 24 bp region spanning nt -444 to -421. A comprehensive mutation study of this ARE revealed that it does not conform to the currently accepted ARE consensus sequence [(5'-TMAnnRTGAYnnnGCRwwww-3', with essential nucleotides shown in capitals); two cytosine residues (shown in bold in the following sequence) that have been designated 'n' previously because they were thought to be redundant (5'-gagTcA C aGTgAGt C ggCAaaatt-3') have now been found to be essential for enhancer activity; two guanines (also shown in bold) previously regarded as essential for ARE function (5'-gagTcACaGT g AGtCg g CAaaatt-3') have proven to be dispensable]. Examination of wild-type and nrf2 (-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated that Nrf2 is essential for both constitutive expression of NQO1 and its induction by sulphoraphane. Electrophoretic mobility-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Nrf2 associates, in low amounts, with the nqo1 ARE under constitutive conditions, and following sulphoraphane challenge of cells, Nrf2 is recruited to the ARE in substantially greater quantities, as a heterodimer with the small Maf (musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma virus) protein, MafK. Also, MafK was found to bind the nqo1 ARE in an Nrf2-independent fashion, and may contribute to transcriptional repression of the oxidoreductase gene. These findings allow a model for transcriptional control of nqo1 through the ARE to be proposed. Furthermore, our results indicate that distinct AREs have differential sequence requirements, and a universally applicable consensus sequence cannot be derived.},

abstract = {We describe the structural analysis of genomic DNA encoding ribosomal protein (rp) L34 from the mosquito, Aedes albopictus. Comparison of genomic DNA sequences encompassing approximately 8 kb with the rpL34 cDNA sequence showed that the gene contains three exons and two introns, encoding a primary transcript with a deduced size of 6196 nucleotides from the transcription start site to the polyadenylation site. Exon 1, which is not translated, measures only 45 bp, and is separated from Exon 2 by a 359 bp intron. Exon 2 measures 78 bp, and contains the AUG translation initiation codon 14 nucleotides downstream of its 5'-end. Downstream of Exon 2 is a 5270 bp intron, followed by the remainder of the coding sequence in Exon 3, which measures 444 bp including the polyadenylation signal. We used a novel PCR-based procedure to obtain 1.7 kb of DNA upstream of the rpL34 gene. Like the previously described Ae. albopictus rpL8 gene and various mammalian rp genes, the DNA immediately upstream of the rpL34 gene lacks the TATA box, and the rpL34 transcription initiation site is embedded in a characteristic polypyrimidine tract. The 5'-flanking DNA contained a number of cis-acting elements that potentially interact with transcription factors characterized by basic domains, zinc-coordinating DNA binding domains, helix-turn-helix motifs, and beta scaffold factors with minor groove contacts. Particularly striking was the conservation of an AP-4 binding site within 100 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site in both Aal-rpL34 and Aal-rpL8 genes. Comparison of Southern hybridization signals using probes from the 5' and 3'-ends of the 5.3 kb second intron and the cDNA suggested that the Ae. albopictus rpL34 gene most likely occurs as a single expressed copy per haploid genome with restriction enzyme polymorphisms in the upstream flanking DNA and the likely presence of one or more pseudogenes.},

abstract = {Ingestion of a blood meal induces two phases of trypsin synthesis in the midgut of Aedes aegypti females. The first phase, which encompasses the first 4-6 hours following a blood meal, is characterized by the presence of small amounts of early trypsin. The second phase, which occurs between 8 and 36 hours after blood feeding, is characterized by the presence of large amounts of late trypsin. A specific form of regulation of trypsin synthesis characterizes each phase: early trypsin synthesis is regulated at the translational level, while late trypsin synthesis is regulated at the transcriptional level.The enzymatic activity of early trypsin plays a unique and critical role in the regulation of late trypsin synthesis. Early trypsin acts like a "sensor". It carries out limited proteolysis of the ingested proteins and, somehow, the products of this limited proteolysis induce synthesis of late trypsin, which is the protease responsible for the majority of the endoproteolytic cleavage of the meal proteins.Transcription of the early trypsin gene starts a few hours after adult emergence and is under control of juvenile hormone. However, the early trypsin mRNA is stored in the midgut epithelium and remains untranslated until a blood meal is taken. The exact mechanism responsible for initiating translation is presently unknown, but an increase in the size of the amino acid pool in the midgut is sufficient to activate translation of early trypsin mRNA.The transcription of the late trypsin gene is regulated by uncharacterized proteolysis products generated by the action of early trypsin on the blood meal proteins. Once transcription has been activated, the rate of transcription of the late trypsin gene is proportional to the amount of protein present in the meal. In addition, the amount of late trypsin protein translation is controlled by the amount of amino acid released during digestion. Regulation at both transcriptional and translational levels allows the midgut to adjust the amount of late trypsin with remarkable flexibility in response to a particular meal.},

We present an expressive and easily comprehensible CRM representation which is capable of capturing several aspects of a CRM's structure and distinguishing between DNA sequences which do or do not contain it. We also present a learning algorithm tailored for this domain, and a novel method to avoid overfitting by controlling the expressivity of the model. RESULTS: We are able to find statistically significant CRMs more often then a current state-of-the-art approach on the same data sets. We also show experimentally that each aspect of our expressive CRM model space makes a positive contribution to the learned models on yeast and fly data. CONCLUSION: Structural aspects are an important part of CRMs, both in terms of interpreting them biologically and learning them accurately.

abstract = {The reliable recognition of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II core promoters, and the associated transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes, has been an ongoing challenge for computational biology. High throughput experimental methods such as tiling arrays or 5' SAGE/EST sequencing have recently lead to much larger datasets of core promoters, and to the assessment that the well-known core promoter sequence elements such as the TATA box appear to be much less frequent than thought. Here, we address the co-occurrence of several previously identified core promoter sequence motifs in Drosophila melanogaster to determine frequently occurring core promoter modules. We then use this in a new strategy to model core promoters as a set of alternative submodels for different core promoter architectures reflecting these different motif modules. We show that this system improves greatly on computational promoter recognition and leads to highly accurate in silico TSS prediction. Our results indicate that at least for the case of the fruit fly, we are getting closer to an understanding of how the beginning of a gene is defined in a eukaryotic genome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The core promoter, a region of about 100 base-pairs flanking the transcription start site (TSS), serves as the recognition site for the basal transcription apparatus. Drosophila TSSs have generally been mapped by individual experiments; the low number of accurately mapped TSSs has limited analysis of promoter sequence motifs and the training of computational prediction tools. RESULTS: We identified TSS candidates for about 2,000 Drosophila genes by aligning 5' expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from cap-trapped cDNA libraries to the genome, while applying stringent criteria concerning coverage and 5'-end distribution. Examination of the sequences flanking these TSSs revealed the presence of well-known core promoter motifs such as the TATA box, the initiator and the downstream promoter element (DPE). We also define, and assess the distribution of, several new motifs prevalent in core promoters, including what appears to be a variant DPE motif. Among the prevalent motifs is the DNA-replication-related element DRE, recently shown to be part of the recognition site for the TBP-related factor TRF2. Our TSS set was then used to retrain the computational promoter predictor McPromoter, allowing us to improve the recognition performance to over 50\% sensitivity and 40\% specificity. We compare these computational results to promoter prediction in vertebrates. CONCLUSIONS: There are relatively few recognizable binding sites for previously known general transcription factors in Drosophila core promoters. However, we identified several new motifs enriched in promoter regions. We were also able to significantly improve the performance of computational TSS prediction in Drosophila.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Germline specific promoters are an essential component of potential vector control strategies which function by genetic drive, however suitable promoters are not currently available for the main human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. RESULTS: We have identified the Anopheles gambiae vasa-like gene and found its expression to be specifically localized to both the male and female gonads in adult mosquitoes. We have functionally characterised using transgenic reporter lines the regulatory regions required for driving transgene expression in a pattern mirroring that of the endogenous vasa locus. Two reporter constructs indicate the existence of distinct vasa regulatory elements within the 5' untranslated regions responsible not only for the spatial and temporal but also for the sex specific germline expression. vasa driven eGFP expression in the ovary of heterozygous mosquitoes resulted in the progressive accumulation of maternal protein and transcript in developing oocytes that were then detectable in all embryos and neonatal larvae. CONCLUSION: We have characterized the vasa regulatory regions that are not only suited to drive transgenes in the early germline of both sexes but could also be utilized to manipulate the zygotic genome of developing embryos via maternal deposition of active molecules. We have used computational models to show that a homing endonuclease-based gene drive system can function in the presence of maternal deposition and describe a novel non-invasive control strategy based on early vasa driven homing endonuclease expression.},

abstract = {Pattern discovery in unaligned DNA sequences is a challenging problem in both computer science and molecular biology. Several different methods and techniques have been proposed so far, but in most of the cases signals in DNA sequences are very complicated and avoid detection. Exact exhaustive methods can solve the problem only for short signals with a limited number of mutations. In this work, we extend exhaustive enumeration also to longer patterns. More in detail, the basic version of algorithm presented in this paper, given as input a set of sequences and an error ratio epsilon < 1, finds all patterns that occur in at least q sequences of the set with at most epsilonm mutations, where m is the length of the pattern. The only restriction is imposed on the location of mutations along the signal. That is, a valid occurrence of a pattern can present at most [epsiloni] mismatches in the first i nucleotides, and so on. However, we show how the algorithm can be used also when no assumption can be made on the position of mutations. In this case, it is also possible to have an estimate of the probability of finding a signal according to the signal length, the error ratio, and the input parameters. Finally, we discuss some significance measures that can be used to sort the patterns output by the algorithm.},

Weeder is a software package freely available for non commercial users as a stand-alone or Web-based application for the automatic discovery of conserved motifs in a set of related DNA sequences from coregulated genes. The motifs found are likely to represent instances of binding sites for some common transcription factor regulating the genes of the set.

abstract = {The steroid hormone ecdysone controls genetic regulatory hierarchies underlying insect molting, metamorphosis and, in some insects, reproduction. Cytogenetic and molecular analysis of ecdysone response in Drosophila larval salivary glands has revealed regulatory hierarchies including early genes which encode transcription factors controlling late ecdysone response. In order to determine whether similar hierarchies control reproductive ecdysone response, we have investigated ecdysone-regulated gene expression in vitellogenic mosquito ovaries and fat bodies. Here, we identify the homologue of the Drosophila E75 early ecdysone inducible gene in the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti, and show that, as in Drosophila, the mosquito homologue, AaE75, consists of three overlapping transcription units with three mRNA isoforms, AaE75A, AaE75B, and AaE75C, originating as a result of alternative splicing. All three AaE75 isoforms are induced at the onset of vitellogenesis by a blood meal-activated hormonal cascade, and highly expressed in the mosquito ovary and fat body, suggesting their involvement in the regulation of oogenesis and vitellogenesis, respectively. Furthermore, in vitro fat body culture experiments demonstrate that AaE75 isoforms are induced by 20-hydroxyecdysone, an active ecdysteroid in the mosquito. These findings suggest that related ecdysone-triggered regulatory hierarchies may be used reiteratively during developmental and reproductive ecdysone responses.},

abstract = {Allantoin pathway gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae responds to two different environmental stimuli. The expression of these genes is induced in the presence of allantoin or its degradative metabolites and repressed when a good nitrogen source (e. g. asparagine or glutamine) is provided. Three types of cis-acting sites and trans-acting factors are required for allantoin pathway gene transcription as follows: (i) UAS(NTR) element associated with the transcriptional activators Gln3p and Gat1p, (ii) URS(GATA) element associated with the repressor Dal80p, and (iii) UIS(ALL) element associated with the Dal82 and Dal81 proteins required for inducer-dependent transcription. Most of the work leading to the above conclusions has employed inducer-independent allantoin pathway genes (e.g. DAL5 and DAL3). The purpose of this work is to extend our understanding of these elements and their roles to inducible allantoin pathway genes using the DAL7 (encoding malate synthase) as a model. We show that eight distinct cis-acting sites participate in the process as follows: a newly identified GC-rich element, two UAS(NTR), two UIS(ALL), and three URS(GATA) elements. The two GATA-containing UAS(NTR) elements are coincident with two of the three GATA sequences that make up the URS(GATA) elements. The remaining URS(GATA) GATA sequence, however, is not a UAS(NTR) element but appears to function only in repression. The data provide insights into how these cis- and trans-acting factors function together to accomplish the regulated expression of the DAL7 gene that is observed in vivo.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Regulation of gene transcription is crucial for the function and development of all organisms. While gene prediction programs that identify protein coding sequence are used with remarkable success in the annotation of genomes, the development of computational methods to analyze noncoding regions and to delineate transcriptional control elements is still in its infancy. RESULTS: Here we present novel algorithms to detect cis-regulatory modules through genome wide scans for clusters of transcription factor binding sites using three levels of prior information. When binding sites for the factors are known, our statistical segmentation algorithm, Ahab, yields about 150 putative gap gene regulated modules, with no adjustable parameters other than a window size. If one or more related modules are known, but no binding sites, repeated motifs can be found by a customized Gibbs sampler and input to Ahab, to predict genes with similar regulation. Finally using only the genome, we developed a third algorithm, Argos, that counts and scores clusters of overrepresented motifs in a window of sequence. Argos recovers many of the known modules, upstream of the segmentation genes, with no training data. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated, in the case of body patterning in the Drosophila embryo, that our algorithms allow the genome-wide identification of regulatory modules. We believe that Ahab overcomes many problems of recent approaches and we estimated the false positive rate to be about 50\%. Argos is the first successful attempt to predict regulatory modules using only the genome without training data. Complete results and module predictions across the Drosophila genome are available at http://uqbar.rockefeller.edu/\~{}siggia/.},

abstract = {The systematic inference of biologically relevant influence networks remains a challenging problem in computational biology. Even though the availability of high-throughput data has enabled the use of probabilistic models to infer the plausible structure of such networks, their true interpretation of the biology of the process is questionable. In this work, we propose a network inference methodology, based on the directed information (DTI) criterion, which incorporates the biology of transcription within the framework, so as to enable experimentally verifiable inference. We use publicly available embryonic kidney and T-cell microarray datasets to demonstrate our results. We present two variants of network inference via DTI (supervised and unsupervised) and the inferred networks relevant to mammalian nephrogenesis as well as T-cell activation. We demonstrate the conformity of the obtained interactions with literature as well as comparison with the coefficient of determination (CoD) method. Apart from network inference, the proposed framework enables the exploration of specific interactions, not just those revealed by data.},

@article{Rasgon2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Replacement of wild-type mosquito populations with genetically modified versions is being explored as a potential strategy to control vector-borne diseases. Due to lower expected relative fitness of transgenic individuals, transgenes must be driven into populations for these scenarios to be successful. Several gene drive mechanisms exist in a theoretical sense but none are currently workable in mosquitoes. Even if strategies were workable, it would be very difficult to recall released transgenes in the event of unforeseen consequences. What is needed is a way to test transgenes in the field for feasibility, efficacy and safety prior to releasing an active drive mechanism. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We outline a method, termed Multi-locus assortment (MLA), to spread transgenes into vector populations by the release of genetically-modified mosquitoes carrying multiple stable transgene inserts. Simulations indicate that [1] insects do not have to carry transgenes at more than 4 loci, [2] transgenes can be maintained at high levels by sequential small releases, the frequency of which depends on the construct fitness cost, and [3] in the case of unforeseen negative non-target effects, transgenes can be eliminated from the population by halting transgenic releases and/or mass releases of wild-type insects. We also discuss potential methods to create MLA mosquito strains in the laboratory. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: While not as efficient as active drive mechanisms, MLA has other advantages: [1] MLA strains can be constructed for some mosquito species with currently-available technology, [2] MLA will allow the ecological components of transgenic mosquito releases to be tested before actual gene drive mechanisms are ready to be deployed, [3] since MLA is not self-propagating, the risk of an accidental premature release into nature is minimized, and [4] in the case that active gene drive mechanisms prove impossible to develop, the MLA approach can be used as a back-up transgene dispersal mechanism for disease control efforts in some systems.},

abstract = {Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malignant malaria, is among the most severe human infectious diseases. The closest known relative of P. falciparum is a chimpanzee parasite, Plasmodium reichenowi, of which one single isolate was previously known. The co-speciation hypothesis suggests that both parasites evolved separately from a common ancestor over the last 5-7 million years, in parallel with the divergence of their hosts, the hominin and chimpanzee lineages. Genetic analysis of eight new isolates of P. reichenowi, from wild and wild-born captive chimpanzees in Cameroon and C\^{o}te d'Ivoire, shows that P. reichenowi is a geographically widespread and genetically diverse chimpanzee parasite. The genetic lineage comprising the totality of global P. falciparum is fully included within the much broader genetic diversity of P. reichenowi. This finding is inconsistent with the co-speciation hypothesis. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that all extant P. falciparum populations originated from P. reichenowi, likely by a single host transfer, which may have occurred as early as 2-3 million years ago, or as recently as 10,000 years ago. The evolutionary history of this relationship may be explained by two critical genetic mutations. First, inactivation of the CMAH gene in the human lineage rendered human ancestors unable to generate the sialic acid Neu5Gc from its precursor Neu5Ac, and likely made humans resistant to P. reichenowi. More recently, mutations in the dominant invasion receptor EBA 175 in the P. falciparum lineage provided the parasite with preference for the overabundant Neu5Ac precursor, accounting for its extreme human pathogenicity.},

abstract = {A synthetic promoter library (SPL) for Lactobacillus plantarum has been developed, which generalizes the approach for obtaining synthetic promoters. The consensus sequence, derived from rRNA promoters extracted from the L. plantarum WCFS1 genome, was kept constant, and the non-consensus sequences were randomized. Construction of the SPL was performed in a vector (pSIP409) previously developed for high-level, inducible gene expression in L. plantarum and Lactobacillus sakei. A wide range of promoter strengths was obtained with the approach, covering 3-4 logs of expression levels in small increments of activity. The SPL was evaluated for the ability to drive beta-glucuronidase (GusA) and aminopeptidase N (PepN) expression. Protein production from the synthetic promoters was constitutive, and the most potent promoters gave high protein production with levels comparable to those of native rRNA promoters, and production of PepN protein corresponding to approximately 10-15 \% of the total cellular protein. High correlation was obtained between the activities of promoters when tested in L. sakei and L. plantarum, which indicates the potential of the SPL for other Lactobacillus species. The SPL enables fine-tuning of stable gene expression for various applications in L. plantarum.},

Advances in our understanding of these behaviours have been recently gained through quantitative models that describe how molecules such as transcription factors and nucleosomes interact with genomic sequences. An emerging view is that every regulatory sequence is associated with a unique binding affinity landscape for each molecule and, consequently, with a unique set of molecule-binding configurations and transcriptional outputs. We present a quantitative framework based on existing methods that unifies these ideas. This framework explains many experimental observations regarding the binding patterns of factors and nucleosomes and the dynamics of transcriptional activation. It can also be used to model more complex phenomena such as transcriptional noise and the evolution of transcriptional regulation.},

abstract = {Drosophila responds to infection by producing a broad range of antimicrobial agents in the fat body and more restricted responses in tissues such as the gut, trachea, and malpighian tubules. The regulation of antimicrobial genes in larval fat depends on linked Rel/NF-kappaB and GATA binding sites. Serpent functions as the major GATA transcription factor in the larval fat body. However, the transcriptional regulation of other tissue-specific responses is less well understood. Here, we present evidence that dGATAe regulates antimicrobial gene expression in the midgut. Regulatory regions for antimicrobial genes Diptericin and Metchnikowin require GATA sites for activation in the midgut, where Grain (dGATAc), dGATAd, and dGATAe are expressed in overlapping domains. Ectopic expression of dGATAe in the larval fat body, where it is normally absent, causes dramatic up-regulation of numerous innate immunity and gut genes, as judged by microarray analysis and in situ hybridization. Ectopic dGATAe also causes a host of symptoms reminiscent of hyperactive Toll (Toll(10b)) mutants, but without apparent activation of Toll signaling. Based on this evidence we propose that dGATAe mediates a Toll-independent immune response in the midgut, providing a window into the first and perhaps most ancient line of animal defense.},

abstract = {Dengue fever is the most frequent arthropod-borne viral disease of humans, with almost half of the world's population at risk of infection. The high prevalence, lack of an effective vaccine, and absence of specific treatment conspire to make dengue fever a global public health threat. Given their compact genomes, dengue viruses (DENV-1-4) and other flaviviruses probably require an extensive number of host factors; however, only a limited number of human, and an even smaller number of insect host factors, have been identified. Here we identify insect host factors required for DENV-2 propagation, by carrying out a genome-wide RNA interference screen in Drosophila melanogaster cells using a well-established 22,632 double-stranded RNA library. This screen identified 116 candidate dengue virus host factors (DVHFs). Although some were previously associated with flaviviruses (for example, V-ATPases and alpha-glucosidases), most of the DVHFs were newly implicated in dengue virus propagation. The dipteran DVHFs had 82 readily recognizable human homologues and, using a targeted short-interfering-RNA screen, we showed that 42 of these are human DVHFs. This indicates notable conservation of required factors between dipteran and human hosts. This work suggests new approaches to control infection in the insect vector and the mammalian host.},

This gene is expressed exclusively in the gut and its mRNA abundance increases after ingestion of a blood meal. Previous experiments with transgenic Drosophila have shown that the enhancer region, from nucleotide -360 bp to -150 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site, is necessary to drive the gut-specific expression of a reporter gene (Skavdis et al., 1996. EMBO J. 15, 344-350). In this study, we defined DNA sequences within this region that are capable of binding nuclear factors from either gut or non-gut tissues. By electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we determined that a gut-specific nuclear factor recognizes and binds to three sites in the enhancer region with a consensus sequence TYCAAGT. Another factor, found in many tissues, recognizes and binds to at least two additional sites with a consensus sequence ACGATA. This study defines for the first time for an insect gut-specific enhancer, specific sequences that interact with nuclear factors.},

abstract = {We established the cis-acting elements which mediate cAMP responsiveness of the human growth hormone (hGH) gene in transiently transfected rat anterior pituitary tumor GC cells. Analysis of the intact hGH gene or hGH 5'-flanking DNA (5'-FR) coupled to the hGh cDNA or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or luciferase genes, indicated that cAMP primarily stimulated hGH promoter activity. Cotransfection of a protein kinase A inhibitory protein cDNA demonstrated that the cAMP response was mediated by protein kinase A. Mutational analysis of the hGH promoter identified two core cAMP response element motifs (CGTCA) located at nucleotides -187/-183 (distal cAMP response element; dCRE) and -99/-95 (proximal cAMP response element; pCRE) and a pituitary-specific transcription factor (GHF1/Pit1) binding site at nucleotides -123/-112 (dGHF1) which were required for cAMP responsiveness. GHF1 was not a limiting factor, since overexpression of GHF1 in cotransfections increased basal but not forskolin induction levels. Gel shift analyses indicated that similar, ubiquitous, thermostable protein(s) specifically bound the pCRE and dCRE motifs. The CGTCA motif-binding factors were cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)/activating transcription factor-1 (ATF-1)-related, since the DNA-protein complex was competed by unlabeled CREB consensus oligonucleotide, specifically supershifted by antisera to CREB and ATF-1 but not ATF-2, and was bound by purified CREB with the same relative binding affinity (pCRE < dCRE < CREB) and mobility as the GC nuclear extract. UV cross-linking and Southwestern blot analyses revealed multiple DNA-protein interactions of which approximately 100- and approximately 45-kDa proteins were predominant; the approximately 45-kDa protein may represent CREB. These results indicate that CREB/ATF-1-related factors act coordinately with the cell-specific factor GHF1 to mediate cAMP-dependent regulation of hGH-1 gene transcription in anterior pituitary somatotrophs.},

abstract = {The Rel/NF-kappa B transcription factor Relish performs a central role in the acute-phase response to microbial challenge by activating immune antibacterial peptides. We cloned and molecularly characterized the gene homologous to Drosophila Relish from the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Unlike Drosophila Relish, Aedes Relish has three alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different proteins. First, the predominant Aedes Relish transcript of 3.9 kb contains both the Rel-homology domains and the inhibitor kappa B (I kappa B)-like domain, which is similar to Drosophila Relish and to the mammalian p105 and p100 Rel/NF-kappa B transcription factors. Second, Aedes Relish transcript contains Rel-homology domains identical to those of the major transcript but it completely lacks the I kappa B-like domain-coding region, which has been replaced by a unique 3'-untranslated region sequence. In the third transcript, a deletion replaces most of the N-terminal sequence and Rel-homology domains; however, the I kappa B-like domain is intact. All three Aedes Relish transcripts were induced by bacterial injection but not by blood feeding. In vitro-translated protein from the Rel-only construct specifically binds to the kappa B motif from Drosophila cecropin A1 and Aedes defensin genes. PCR and Southern blot hybridization analyses show that these three transcripts originated from the same large inducible mRNA encoded by a single Relish gene.},

Quantitative, tag-based studies of gene expression were one of the earliest applications of these next-generation technologies, but the tremendous depth of sequencing facilitates de novo transcript discovery, which replaces traditional expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing. In addition, these technologies have created new opportunities for understanding the generation, stability, and decay of RNA and the impacts of chromatin differences on gene expression. As we review the impact of these methods on plant biology, we also mention published studies from animal systems when the methods are broadly applicable. We can anticipate that the published work over the past few years is a harbinger of much broader studies that are yet to be published and are sure to further advance our understanding of plant genomes in a field changing at a dizzying pace.},

abstract = {Combinatorial regulation is an important feature of eukaryotic transcription. However, only a limited number of studies have characterized this aspect on a whole-genome level. We have conducted a genome-wide computational survey to identify cis-regulatory motif pairs that co-occur in a significantly high number of promoters in the S. cerevisiae genome. A pair of novel motifs, mRRPE and PAC, co-occur most highly in the genome, primarily in the promoters of genes involved in rRNA transcription and processing. The two motifs show significant positional and orientational bias with mRRPE being closer to the ATG than PAC in most promoters. Two additional rRNA-related motifs, mRRSE3 and mRRSE10, also co-occur with mRRPE and PAC. mRRPE and PAC are the primary determinants of expression profiles while mRRSE3 and mRRSE10 modulate these patterns. We describe a new computational approach for studying the functional significance of the physical locations of promoter elements that combine analyses of genome sequence and microarray data. Applying this methodology to the regulatory cassette containing the four rRNA motifs demonstrates that the relative promoter locations of these elements have a profound effect on the expression patterns of the downstream genes. These findings provide a function for these novel motifs and insight into the mechanism by which they regulate gene expression. The methodology introduced here should prove particularly useful for analyzing transcriptional regulation in more complex genomes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The detection of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that mediate transcriptional responses in eukaryotes remains a key challenge in the postgenomic era. A CRM is characterized by a set of co-occurring transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). In silico methods have been developed to search for CRMs by determining the combination of TFBS that are statistically overrepresented in a certain geneset. Most of these methods solve this combinatorial problem by relying on computational intensive optimization methods. As a result their usage is limited to finding CRMs in small datasets (containing a few genes only) and using binding sites for a restricted number of transcription factors (TFs) out of which the optimal module will be selected. RESULTS: We present an itemset mining based strategy for computationally detecting cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in a set of genes. We tested our method by applying it on a large benchmark data set, derived from a ChIP-Chip analysis and compared its performance with other well known cis-regulatory module detection tools. CONCLUSION: We show that by exploiting the computational efficiency of an itemset mining approach and combining it with a well-designed statistical scoring scheme, we were able to prioritize the biologically valid CRMs in a large set of coregulated genes using binding sites for a large number of potential TFs as input.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systemic administration of non-viral gene therapy provides better access to tumors than local administration. Development of a promoter that restricts expression of cytotoxic proteins to the tumor vasculature will increase the safety of the system by minimizing expression in the non-dividing endothelial cells of the vasculature of non-target tissues. METHODS: Cell cycle promoters were tested for selective expression in dividing cells vs. non-dividing cells in vitro and promoter strength was compared to the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Successful promoter candidates were tested in vivo using two proliferating endothelium mouse models. Ovarectomized mice were injected with estradiol prior to lipoplex administration and expression levels were measured in the lungs and uterus 4 days after administration. The second model was a subcutaneous tumor model and expression levels were measured in the lungs and tumors. For both animal models, expression levels from the proliferating endothelium promoter were compared to that obtained from a CMV promoter. RESULTS: The results showed that the Cdc6 promoter yielded higher expression in proliferating vs. non-proliferating cells. Secondly, promoter strength could be selectively increased in endothelial cells by the addition of a multimerized endothelin enhancer (ET) to the Cdc6 promoter. Thirdly, comparison of expression levels in the lungs vs. uterus in the ovarectomized mouse model and lungs vs. tumor in the mouse tumor model showed expression was much higher in the uterus and the tumor than in the lungs for the ET/Cdc6 promoter, and expression levels were comparable to that of the CMV promoter in the hypervascularized tissues. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the combination of the endothelin enhancer with the Cdc6 promoter yields selective expression in proliferating endothelium and can be used to express cytotoxic proteins to treat vascularized tumors.},

RESULTS: We have developed MicroTar, an animal miRNA target prediction tool based on miRNA-target complementarity and thermodynamic data. The algorithm uses predicted free energies of unbound mRNA and putative mRNA-miRNA heterodimers, implicitly addressing the accessibility of the mRNA 3' untranslated region. MicroTar does not rely on evolutionary conservation to discern functional targets, and is able to predict both conserved and non-conserved targets. MicroTar source code and predictions are accessible at http://tiger.dbs.nus.edu.sg/microtar/, where both serial and parallel versions of the program can be downloaded under an open-source licence.

@article{Wang1998,
abstract = {The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone is a key regulatory factor, controlling blood-meal triggered egg maturation in mosquitoes. To elucidate the ecdysone hierarchy governing this event, we cloned and characterized the ecdysone receptor (AaEcR) and the nuclear receptor Ultraspiracle (AaUSP), a retinoid X receptor homologue, from the mosquito, Aedes aegypti, which form a functional complex capable of ligand and DNA binding. Here we analyzed the DNA-binding properties of the AaEcR.AaUSP heterodimer with respect to the effects of nucleotide sequence, orientation, and spacing between half-sites in natural Drosophila and synthetic ecdysone response element (EcREs). By using an electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay, we showed that AaEcR.AaUSP exhibits a broad binding specificity, forming complexes with inverted (IR) and direct (DR) repeats of the nuclear receptor response element half-site consensus sequence AGGTCA separated by spacers of variable length. A single nucleotide spacer was optimal for both imperfect (IRhsp-1) and perfect (IRper-1) inverted repeats; adding or removing 1 base pair in an IRhsp-1 spacer practically abolished binding. However, changing the half-site to the consensus sequence AGGTCA (IRper-1) increased binding of AaEcR.AaUSP 10-fold over IRhsp-1 and, at the same time, reduced the stringency of the spacer length requirement, with IRper-0 to IRper-5 showing detectable binding. Spacer length was less important in DRs of AGGTCA (DR-0 to DR-5); although 4 bp was optimal, DR-3 and DR-5 bound AaEcR.AaUSP almost as efficiently as DR-4. Furthermore, AaEcR. AaUSP also bound DRs separated by 11-13 nucleotide spacers. Competition experiments and direct estimation of binding affinity (Kd) indicated that, given identical consensus half-sites and an optimal spacer, the AaEcR.AaUSP heterodimer bound an IR with higher affinity than a DR. Co-transfection assays utilizing CV-1 cells demonstrated that the mosquito EcR.USP heterodimer is capable of transactivating reporter constructs containing either IR-1 or DR-4. The levels of transactivation are correlated with the respective binding affinities of the response elements (IRper-1 > DR-4 > IRhsp-1). Taken together, these analyses predict broad variability in the EcREs of mosquito ecdysone-responsive genes.},

abstract = {Target predictions and validations are major obstacles facing microRNA (miRNA) researchers. Animal miRNA target prediction is challenging because of limited miRNA sequence complementarity to the targets. In addition, only a small number of predicted targets have been experimentally validated and the miRNA mechanism is poorly understood. Here we present a novel algorithm for animal miRNA target prediction. The algorithm combines relevant parameters for miRNA target recognition and heuristically assigns different weights to these parameters according to their relative importance. A score calculation scheme is introduced to reflect the strength of each parameter. We also performed microarray time course experiments to identify downregulated genes due to miRNA overexpression. The computational target prediction is combined with the miRNA transfection experiment to systematically identify the gene targets of human miR-124. miR-124 overexpression led to a significant downregulation of many cell cycle related genes. This may be the result of direct suppression of a few cell growth inhibitors at the early stage of miRNA overexpression, and these targeted genes were continuously suppressed over a long period of time. Our high-throughput approach can be generalized to globally identify the targets and functions of other miRNAs.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Identification of a transcription factor binding sites is an important aspect of the analysis of genetic regulation. Many programs have been developed for the de novo discovery of a binding motif (collection of binding sites). Recently, a scoring function formulation was derived that allows for the comparison of discovered motifs from different programs [S.T. Jensen, X.S. Liu, Q. Zhou and J.S. Liu (2004) Stat. Sci., 19, 188-204.] A simple program, BioOptimizer, was proposed in [S.T. Jensen and J.S. Liu (2004) Bioinformatics, 20, 1557-1564.] that improved discovered motifs by optimizing a scoring function. However, BioOptimizer is a very simple algorithm that can only make local improvements upon an already discovered motif and so BioOptimizer can only be used in conjunction with other motif-finding software. RESULTS: We introduce software, GAME, which utilizes a genetic algorithm to find optimal motifs in DNA sequences. GAME evolves motifs with high fitness from a population of randomly generated starting motifs, which eliminate the reliance on additional motif-finding programs. In addition to using standard genetic operations, GAME also incorporates two additional operators that are specific to the motif discovery problem. We demonstrate the superior performance of GAME compared with MEME, BioProspector and BioOptimizer in simulation studies as well as several real data applications where we use an extended version of the GAME algorithm that allows the motif width to be unknown.},

abstract = {The malaria parasite Plasmodium has an absolute requirement for both a vertebrate and a mosquito host in order to complete its life cycle, and its interactions with the latter provide the focus for this review. The mosquito midgut represents one of the most challenging environments for the survival and development of Plasmodium, and is thus also one of the most attractive sites for novel targeted malaria control strategies. During their attempts to cross the midgut epithelium en route to the salivary glands, motile ookinetes are swiftly detected and labelled by mosquito recognition factors and targeted for destruction by a variety of immune responses that recruit killing factors both from the midgut and from other tissues in the surrounding body cavity. The exact interplay between these factors and the parasite is highly species- and strain-specific, as are the timing and the route of parasite invasion. These features are paramount to determining the success of the infection and the vector competence of the mosquito. Here we discuss recent advances in genomic analyses, coupled with detailed microscopical investigations, which are helping to unravel the identity and roles of the major players of these complex systems.},

Despite their importance, cis-regulatory regions remain one of the most enigmatic features of the genome. Patterns of sequence evolution can be used to identify cis-regulatory elements, but the power of this approach depends upon the relationship between sequence and function. Comparative studies of gene regulation among Diptera reveal that divergent sequences can underlie conserved expression, and that expression differences can evolve despite largely similar sequences. This complex structure-function relationship is the primary impediment for computational identification and interpretation of cis-regulatory sequences. Biochemical characterization and in vivo assays of cis-regulatory sequences on a genomic-scale will relieve this barrier.},

abstract = {Gene expression is central to the genotype-phenotype relationship in all organisms, and it is an important component of the genetic basis for evolutionary change in diverse aspects of phenotype. However, the evolution of transcriptional regulation remains understudied and poorly understood. Here we review the evolutionary dynamics of promoter, or cis-regulatory, sequences and the evolutionary mechanisms that shape them. Existing evidence indicates that populations harbor extensive genetic variation in promoter sequences, that a substantial fraction of this variation has consequences for both biochemical and organismal phenotype, and that some of this functional variation is sorted by selection. As with protein-coding sequences, rates and patterns of promoter sequence evolution differ considerably among loci and among clades for reasons that are not well understood. Studying the evolution of transcriptional regulation poses empirical and conceptual challenges beyond those typically encountered in analyses of coding sequence evolution: promoter organization is much less regular than that of coding sequences, and sequences required for the transcription of each locus reside at multiple other loci in the genome. Because of the strong context-dependence of transcriptional regulation, sequence inspection alone provides limited information about promoter function. Understanding the functional consequences of sequence differences among promoters generally requires biochemical and in vivo functional assays. Despite these challenges, important insights have already been gained into the evolution of transcriptional regulation, and the pace of discovery is accelerating.},

abstract = {In holometabolous insects such as mosquito, Aedes aegypti, midgut undergoes remodeling during metamorphosis. Insect metamorphosis is regulated by several hormones including juvenile hormone (JH) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). The cellular and molecular events that occur during midgut remodeling were investigated by studying nuclear stained whole mounts and cross-sections of midguts and by monitoring the mRNA levels of genes involved in 20E action in methoprene-treated and untreated Ae. aegypti. We used JH analog, methoprene, to mimic JH action. In Ae. aegypti larvae, the programmed cell death (PCD) of larval midgut cells and the proliferation and differentiation of imaginal cells were initiated at about 36h after ecdysis to the 4th instar larval stage (AEFL) and were completed by 12h after ecdysis to the pupal stage (AEPS). In methoprene-treated larvae, the proliferation and differentiation of imaginal cells was initiated at 36h AEFL, but the PCD was initiated only after ecdysis to the pupal stage. However, the terminal events that occur for completion of PCD during pupal stage were blocked. As a result, the pupae developed from methoprene-treated larvae contained two midgut epithelial layers until they died during the pupal stage. Quantitative PCR analyses showed that methoprene affected midgut remodeling by modulating the expression of ecdysone receptor B, ultraspiracle A, broad complex, E93, ftz-f1, dronc and drice, the genes that are shown to play key roles in 20E action and PCD. Thus, JH analog, methoprene acts on Ae. aegypti by interfering with the expression of genes involved in 20E action resulting in a block in midgut remodeling and death during pupal stage.},

abstract = {The subdivision of the lateral mesoderm into a visceral (splanchnic) and a somatic layer is a crucial event during early mesoderm development in both arthropod and vertebrate embryos. In Drosophila, this subdivision leads to the differential development of gut musculature versus body wall musculature. Here we report that biniou, the sole Drosophila representative of the FoxF subfamily of forkhead domain genes, has a key role in the development of the visceral mesoderm and the derived gut musculature. biniou expression is activated in the trunk visceral mesoderm primordia downstream of dpp, tinman, and bagpipe and is maintained in all types of developing gut muscles. We show that biniou activity is essential for maintaining the distinction between splanchnic and somatic mesoderm and for differentiation of the splanchnic mesoderm into midgut musculature. biniou is required not only for the activation of differentiation genes that are expressed ubiquitously in the trunk visceral mesoderm but also for the expression of dpp in parasegment 7, which governs proper midgut morphogenesis. Activation of dpp is mediated by specific Biniou binding sites in a dpp enhancer element, which suggests that Biniou serves as a tissue-specific cofactor of homeotic gene products in visceral mesoderm patterning. Based upon these and other data, we propose that the splanchnic mesoderm layers in Drosophila and vertebrate embryos are homologous structures whose development into gut musculature and other visceral organs is critically dependent on FoxF genes.},

Recent in vivo footprinting studies have shown that GATA and HNF3 binding sites in chromatin are occupied on a silent gene in endoderm that has the potential to be activated solely in that germ layer.

The ability to respond to hormones is determined by the competence of a cell or a tissue. The betaFtz-F1 orphan nuclear receptor acts as a competence factor for the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) in Drosophila melanogaster metamorphosis and mosquito reproduction. The molecular nature of the betaFtz-F1 action remains unclear. We report that the protein-protein interaction between betaFtz-F1 and a p160/SRC coactivator of the ecdysone receptor, FISC, is crucial for the stage-specific expression of the 20E effector genes during mosquito reproduction. This interaction dramatically increases recruitment of FISC to the functional ecdysone receptor in a 20E-dependent manner. The presence of betaFtz-F1 facilitates loading of FISC and the ecdysone receptor on the target promoters, leading to enhanced local histone H4 acetylation and robust activation of the target genes. Thus, our results reveal the molecular basis of competence for the stage-specific 20E response.},

abstract = {Oocyst formation is a critical stage in the development of the malaria parasite in the mosquito. We have discovered that the phospholipase A(2) (PLA2) from the venom of the eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus) inhibits oocyst formation when added to infected chicken blood and fed to mosquitoes. A similar transmission-blocking activity was demonstrated for PLA2s from the venom of other snakes and from the honeybee. This effect is seen both with the avian malaria parasite Plasmodium gallinaceum and with the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum developing in their respective mosquito hosts. The inhibition occurs even in the presence of an irreversible inhibitor of the active site of PLA2, indicating that the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme is not required for the antiparasitic effect. Inhibition is also seen when the enzyme is fed to mosquitoes together with ookinetes, suggesting that the inhibition occurs after ookinete maturation. PLA2 has no direct effect on the parasite. However, pretreatment of midguts with PLA2 (catalytically active or inactive) dramatically lowers the level of ookinete/midgut association in vitro. It appears, therefore, that PLA2 is acting by associating with the midgut surface and preventing ookinete attachment to this surface. Thus, PLA2 is an excellent candidate for expression in transgenic mosquitoes as a means of inhibiting the transmission of malaria.},

abstract = {The early Drosophila embryo is emerging as a premiere model system for the computational analysis of gene regulation in development because most of the genes, and many of the associated regulatory DNAs, that control segmentation and gastrulation are known. The comprehensive elucidation of Drosophila gene networks provides an unprecedented opportunity to apply quantitative models to metazoan enhancers that govern complex patterns of gene expression during development. Models based on the fractional occupancy of defined DNA binding sites have been used to describe the regulation of the lac operon in E. coli and the lysis/lysogeny switch of phage lambda. Here, we apply similar models to enhancers regulated by the Dorsal gradient in the ventral neurogenic ectoderm (vNE) of the early Drosophila embryo. Quantitative models based on the fractional occupancy of Dorsal, Twist, and Snail binding sites raise the possibility that cooperative interactions among these regulatory proteins mediate subtle differences in the vNE expression patterns. Variations in cooperativity may be attributed to differences in the detailed linkage of Dorsal, Twist, and Snail binding sites in vNE enhancers. We propose that binding site occupancy is the key rate-limiting step for establishing localized patterns of gene expression in the early Drosophila embryo.},

abstract = {The exponential growth in the volume of accessible biological information has generated a confusion of voices surrounding the annotation of molecular information about genes and their products. The Gene Ontology (GO) project seeks to provide a set of structured vocabularies for specific biological domains that can be used to describe gene products in any organism. This work includes building three extensive ontologies to describe molecular function, biological process, and cellular component, and providing a community database resource that supports the use of these ontologies. The GO Consortium was initiated by scientists associated with three model organism databases: SGD, the Saccharomyces Genome database; FlyBase, the Drosophila genome database; and MGD/GXD, the Mouse Genome Informatics databases. Additional model organism database groups are joining the project. Each of these model organism information systems is annotating genes and gene products using GO vocabulary terms and incorporating these annotations into their respective model organism databases. Each database contributes its annotation files to a shared GO data resource accessible to the public at http://www.geneontology.org/. The GO site can be used by the community both to recover the GO vocabularies and to access the annotated gene product data sets from the model organism databases. The GO Consortium supports the development of the GO database resource and provides tools enabling curators and researchers to query and manipulate the vocabularies. We believe that the shared development of this molecular annotation resource will contribute to the unification of biological information.},

abstract = {Accumulated genetic data are stimulating the use of mathematical and computational tools for studying the concerted action of genes during cell differentiation and morphogenetic processes. At the same time, network theory has flourished, enabling analyses of complex systems that have multiple elements and interactions. Reverse engineering methods that use genomic data or detailed experiments on gene interactions have been used to propose gene network architectures. Experiments on gene interactions incorporate enough detail for relatively small developmental modules and thus allow dynamical analyses that have direct functional interpretations. Generalities are beginning to emerge. For example, biological genetic networks are robust to environmental and genetic perturbations. Such dynamical studies also enable novel predictions that can lead to further experimental tests, which might then feedback to the theoretical analyses. This interplay is proving productive for understanding plant development. Finally, both experiments on gene interactions and theoretical analyses allow the identification of frequent or fixed evolutionary solutions to developmental problems, and thus are contributing to an understanding of the genetic basis of the evolution of development and body plan.},

Researchers are confronted with the seemingly arbitrary choice between numerous algorithms to perform cluster analysis. RESULTS: We developed an exploratory application that benchmarks the results of clustering methods using functional annotations. In addition, a de novo DNA motif discovery algorithm is integrated in our program which identifies overrepresented DNA binding sites in the upstream DNA sequences of genes from the clusters that are indicative of sites of transcriptional control. The performance of our program was evaluated by comparing the original results of a time course experiment with the findings of our application. CONCLUSION: DISCLOSE assists researchers in the prokaryotic research community in systematically evaluating results of the application of a range of clustering algorithms to transcriptome data. Different performance measures allow to quickly and comprehensively determine the best suited clustering approach for a given dataset.},

abstract = {Blood meal digestion in mosquitoes occurs in two phases, an early phase that is translationally regulated, and a late phase that is transcriptionally regulated. Early trypsin is a well-characterized serine endoprotease that is representative of other early phase proteases in the midgut that are only synthesized after feeding. Since the kinase Target of Rapamycin (TOR) has been implicated as a nutrient sensor in other systems, including the mosquito fat body, we tested if TOR signaling is involved in early trypsin protein synthesis in the mosquito midgut in response to feeding. We found that ingestion of an amino acid meal by female mosquitoes induces early trypsin protein synthesis, coincident with phosphorylation of two known TOR target proteins, p70S6 kinase (S6K) and the translational repressor 4E-Binding Protein (4E-BP). Moreover, in vitro culturing of midguts from unfed mosquitoes led to amino acid-dependent phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP which could be blocked by treatment with rapamycin, a TOR-specific inhibitor. Lastly, by injecting mosquitoes with TOR double stranded RNA (dsRNA) or rapamycin, we demonstrated that TOR signaling was required in vivo for both phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP in the midgut, and for translation of early trypsin mRNA in response to amino acid feeding. It may be possible to target the TOR signaling pathway in the midgut to inhibit blood meal digestion, and thereby, decrease fecundity and the spread of mosquito borne diseases.},

abstract = {Promising new sequencing technologies, based on sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS), are starting to deliver large amounts of DNA sequence at very low cost. Polymorphism detection is a key application. We describe general methods for improved quality scores and accurate automated polymorphism detection, and apply them to data from the Roche (454) Genome Sequencer 20. We assess our methods using known-truth data sets, which is critical to the validity of the assessments. We developed informative, base-by-base error predictors for this sequencer and used a variant of the phred binning algorithm to combine them into a single empirically derived quality score. These quality scores are more useful than those produced by the system software: They both better predict actual error rates and identify many more high-quality bases. We developed a SNP detection method, with variants for low coverage, high coverage, and PCR amplicon applications, and evaluated it on known-truth data sets.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The genomewide pattern of changes in mRNA expression measured using DNA microarrays is typically a complex superposition of the response of multiple regulatory pathways to changes in the environment of the cells. The use of prior information, either about the function of the protein encoded by each gene, or about the physical interactions between regulatory factors and the sequences controlling its expression, has emerged as a powerful approach for dissecting complex transcriptional responses. RESULTS: We review two different approaches for combining the noisy expression levels of multiple individual genes into robust pathway-level differential expression scores. The first is based on a comparison between the distribution of expression levels of genes within a predefined gene set and those of all other genes in the genome. The second starts from an estimate of the strength of genomewide regulatory network connectivities based on sequence information or direct measurements of protein-DNA interactions, and uses regression analysis to estimate the activity of gene regulatory pathways. The statistical methods used are explained in detail. CONCLUSION: By avoiding the thresholding of individual genes, pathway-level analysis of differential expression based on prior information can be considerably more sensitive to subtle changes in gene expression than gene-level analysis. The methods are technically straightforward and yield results that are easily interpretable, both biologically and statistically.},

@article{Copley2007,
abstract = {Evolutionary constraints on gene regulatory elements are poorly understood: Little is known about how the strength of transcription factor binding correlates with DNA sequence conservation, and whether transcription factor binding sites can evolve rapidly while retaining their function. Here we use the model of the NFKB/Rel-dependent gene regulation in divergent Drosophila species to examine the hypothesis that the functional properties of authentic transcription factor binding sites are under stronger evolutionary constraints than the genomic background. Using molecular modeling we compare tertiary structures of the Drosophila Rel family proteins Dorsal, Dif, and Relish and demonstrate that their DNA-binding and protein dimerization domains undergo distinct rates of evolution. The accumulated amino acid changes, however, are unlikely to affect DNA sequence recognition and affinity. We employ our recently developed microarray-based experimental platform and principal coordinates statistical analysis to quantitatively and systematically profile DNA binding affinities of three Drosophila Rel proteins to 10,368 variants of the NFKB recognition sequences. We then correlate the evolutionary divergence of gene regulatory regions with differences in DNA binding affinities. Genome-wide analyses reveal a significant increase in the number of conserved Rel binding sites in promoters of developmental and immune genes. Significantly, the affinity of Rel proteins to these sites was higher than to less conserved sites and was maintained by the conservation of the DNA binding site sequence (static conservation) or in some cases despite significantly diverged sequences (dynamic conservation). We discuss how two types of conservation may contribute to the stabilization and optimization of a functional gene regulatory code in evolution.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Invertebrate and vertebrate GATA transcription factors play important roles in ectoderm and mesendoderm development, as well as in cardiovascular and blood cell fate specification. However, the assignment of evolutionarily conserved roles to GATA homologs requires a detailed framework of orthologous relationships. Although two distinct classes, GATA123 and GATA456, have been unambiguously recognized among deuterostome GATA genes, it has been difficult to resolve exact orthologous relationships among protostome homologs. Protostome GATA genes are often present in multiple copies within any one genome, and rapidly evolving gene sequences have obscured orthology among arthropod and nematode GATA homologs. In addition, a lack of taxonomic sampling has prevented a stepwise reconstruction of protostome GATA gene family evolution. RESULTS: We have identified the complete GATA complement (53 genes) from a diverse sampling of protostome genomes, including six arthropods, three lophotrochozoans, and two nematodes. Reciprocal best hit BLAST analysis suggested orthology of these GATA genes to either the ancestral bilaterian GATA123 or the GATA456 class. Using molecular phylogenetic analyses of gene sequences, together with conserved synteny and comparisons of intron/exon structure, we inferred the evolutionary relationships among these 53 protostome GATA homologs. In particular, we resolved the orthology and evolutionary birth order of all arthropod GATA homologs including the highly divergent Drosophila GATA genes. CONCLUSION: Our combined analyses confirm that all protostome GATA transcription factor genes are members of either the GATA123 or GATA456 class, and indicate that there have been multiple protostome-specific duplications of GATA456 homologs. Three GATA456 genes exhibit linkage in multiple protostome species, suggesting that this gene cluster arose by tandem duplications from an ancestral GATA456 gene. Within arthropods this GATA456 cluster appears orthologous and widely conserved. Furthermore, the intron/exon structures of the arthropod GATA456 orthologs suggest a distinct order of gene duplication events. At present, however, the evolutionary relationship to similarly linked GATA456 paralogs in lophotrochozoans remains unclear. Our study shows how sampling of additional genomic data, especially from less derived and interspersed protostome taxa, can be used to resolve the orthologous relationships within more divergent gene families.},

abstract = {cis-Regulatory DNA elements contain multiple binding sites for activators and repressors of transcription. Among these elements are enhancers, which establish gene expression states, and Polycomb/Trithorax response elements (PREs), which take over from enhancers and maintain transcription states of several hundred developmentally important genes. PREs are essential to the correct identities of both stem cells and differentiated cells. Evolutionary differences in cis-regulatory elements are a rich source of phenotypic diversity, and functional binding sites within regulatory elements turn over rapidly in evolution. However, more radical evolutionary changes that go beyond motif turnover have been difficult to assess. We used a combination of genome-wide bioinformatic prediction and experimental validation at specific loci, to evaluate PRE evolution across four Drosophila species. Our results show that PRE evolution is extraordinarily dynamic. First, we show that the numbers of PREs differ dramatically between species. Second, we demonstrate that functional binding sites within PREs at conserved positions turn over rapidly in evolution, as has been observed for enhancer elements. Finally, although it is theoretically possible that new elements can arise out of nonfunctional sequence, evidence that they do so is lacking. We show here that functional PREs are found at nonorthologous sites in conserved gene loci. By demonstrating that PRE evolution is not limited to the adaptation of preexisting elements, these findings document a novel dimension of cis-regulatory evolution.},

abstract = {We have developed a novel molecular genetic approach to investigating gene regulation in adult mosquitoes called whole body transfection (WBT). This DNA microinjection method allows for both constitutive and regulated expression of plasmid vectors in the fat body and midgut of adult mosquitoes within 24 h of injection. Using a luciferase reporter gene containing the Aedes aegypti heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) promoter, we optimized the WBT protocol at various times post-injection and used these parameters to measure the expression of a vitellogenin-luciferase reporter gene in response to blood meal feeding. These studies showed that a 843 bp fragment of the Ae. aegypti vitellogenin-C (VgC) promoter caused a greater than 200-fold induction of luciferase activity in a strict tissue-specific manner, and only in response to feeding. Functional mapping of the VgC promoter by WBT identified essential upstream regulatory elements in the region spanning -780 to -182 bp from the transcriptional start site. We also constructed a lipopolysaccharide-regulated expression vector using a 1096 bp genomic fragment of the Ae. aegypti cecropin B (CecB) promoter. Our data show that four days after WBT injection, the CecB-luciferase reporter gene could be induced more than 100-fold in the fat body following lipopolysaccharide injection. Moreover, we found that lipopolysaccharide-induction of the CecB reporter gene occurred up to 28 days post-WBT injection. These data suggest that WBT could provide a novel strategy to express recombinant proteins and RNAi constructs in adult mosquitoes using conventional microinjection methods.},

@article{Isoe2007a,
abstract = {Comparative sequence analysis of mosquito vitellogenin (Vg) genes was carried out to gain a better understanding of their evolution. The genomic clones of vitellogenin genes were isolated and sequenced from all three subfamilies of the family Culicidae including Culicinae (Aedes aegypti, Ochlerotatus atropalpus, Ae. polynesiensis, Ae. albopictus, Ochlerotatus triseriatus and Culex quinquefasciatus), Toxorhynchitinae (Toxorhynchites amboinensis), and Anophelinae (Anopheles albimanus). Genomic clones of vitellogenin genes Vg-B and Vg-C were isolated from Ae. aegypti and sequenced. A comparison of Vg-B and Vg-C, with the previously characterized vitellogenin gene, Vg-A1, suggests that Vg-A1 and Vg-B probably arose by a recent gene duplication, and Vg-C apparently diverged from the two other members of the gene family in an earlier gene duplication event. Two vitellogenin genes orthologous to Vg-C were cloned from a Cx. quinquefasciatus DNA library, one of which is truncated at the N-terminal end. Single vitellogenin genes, orthologous to Vg-C, were cloned from the An. albimanus and Tx. amboinensis libraries. Incomplete sequences orthologous to Vg-B and Vg-C were isolated from the Oc. atropalpus library. Only partial sequences were isolated from Ae. polynesiensis, Ae. albopictus and Oc. triseriatus. Inferred phylogenetic relationships based on analysis of these sequences suggest that Vg-C was the ancestral gene and that a recent gene duplication gave rise to Vg-A1 and Vg-B after the separation of the genus Aedes. The deduced amino acid composition of mosquito vitellogenin proteins exhibits higher tyrosine and phenylalanine composition than other mosquito proteins except for the hexamerin storage proteins. Analysis of vitellogenin coding sequences showed that a majority of amino acid substitutions were due to conserved and moderately conserved changes suggesting that the vitellogenins are under moderately selective constrains to maintain tertiary structure. The vitellogenin genes of the three anautogenous mosquitoes, that require a blood meal to develop eggs, had very high synonymous codon usage biases similar to highly expressed genes of other organisms. On the other hand, the vitellogenin genes of autogenous mosquitoes, that develop at least one batch of eggs without a blood meal, exhibited low synonymous codon usage bias. An unusual pattern of synonymous codon usage was observed in the first 15 amino acid residues encoding the signal peptide in the vitellogenin genes, where a high number of rarely used synonymous codons are present. It is hypothesized that rare synonymous codons have selectively accumulated in the signal peptide region to down-regulate the rate of translation initiation in the absence of a blood meal. Real-time PCR gene expression experiments showed that all three Ae. aegypti vitellogenin genes were highly expressed after a blood meal, and expressed in non-blood-fed females, males, larvae and pupae at trace levels. Sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers: Ae. aegypti Vg-B, AY380797, Vg-C, AY373377; Oc. atropalpus Vg-B, AY691321, Vg-C, AY691322; Ae. polynesiensis Vg-A1, AY691318, Vg-B, AY691319, Vg-C, AY691320; Ae. albopictus Vg-A1, AY691316, Vg-C, AY691317; Oc. triseriatus Vg-C, AY691323; Cx. quinquefasciatus Vg-C1, AY691324, Vg-C2, AY691325; Tx. amboinensis Vg-C, AY691326; An. albimanus Vg-C, AY691327).},

@article{Kankainen2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sequence motifs representing transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) are commonly encoded as position frequency matrices (PFM) or degenerate consensus sequences (CS). These formats are used to represent the characterised TFBS profiles stored in transcription factor databases, as well as to represent the potential motifs predicted using computational methods. To fill the gap between the known and predicted motifs, methods are needed for the post-processing of prediction results, i.e. for matching, comparison and clustering of pre-selected motifs. The computational identification of over-represented motifs in sets of DNA sequences is, in particular, a task where post-processing can dramatically simplify the analysis. Efficient post-processing, for example, reduces the redundancy of the motifs predicted and enables them to be annotated. RESULTS: In order to facilitate the post-processing of motifs, in both PFM and CS formats, we have developed a tool called Matlign. The tool aligns and evaluates the similarity of motifs using a combination of scoring functions, and visualises the results using hierarchical clustering. By limiting the number of distinct gaps created (though, not their length), the alignment algorithm also correctly aligns motifs with an internal spacer. The method selects the best non-redundant motif set, with repetitive motifs merged together, by cutting the hierarchical tree using silhouette values. Our analyses show that Matlign can reliably discover the most similar analogue from a collection of characterised regulatory elements such that the method is also useful for the annotation of motif predictions by PFM library searches. CONCLUSION: Matlign is a user-friendly tool for post-processing large collections of DNA sequence motifs. Starting from a large number of potential regulatory motifs, Matlign provides a researcher with a non-redundant set of motifs, which can then be further associated to known regulatory elements. A web-server is available at http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/poxo/matlign.},

abstract = {IkappaB-zeta [inhibitor of NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) zeta] is a nuclear protein that is induced upon stimulation of TLRs (Toll-like receptors) and IL (interleukin)-1 receptor. IkappaB-zeta harbours C-terminal ankyrin repeats that interact with NF-kappaB. Our recent studies have shown that, upon stimulation, IkappaB-zeta is essential for the induction of a subset of inflammatory genes, represented by IL-6, whereas it inhibits the expression of TNF (tumour necrosis factor)-alpha. In the present study, we investigated mechanisms that determine the different functions of IkappaB-zeta. We found that co-expression of IkappaB-zeta and the NF-kappaB subunits synergistically activates transcription of the hBD-2 (human beta-defensin 2) and NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) genes, whereas it inhibits transcription of E-selectin. Reporter analyses indicated that, in addition to an NF-kappaB-binding site, a flanking C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein)-binding site in the promoters is essential for the IkappaB-zeta-mediated transcriptional activation. Using an artificial promoter consisting of the NF-kappaB- and C/EBP-binding sites, transcriptional activation was observed upon co-transfection with IkappaB-zeta and NF-kappaB, indicating that these sequences are minimal elements that confer the IkappaB-zeta-mediated transcriptional activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and knockdown experiments showed that both IkappaB-zeta and the NF-kappaB subunits were recruited to the NGAL promoter and were essential for the transcriptional activation of the hBD-2 and NGAL promoters on stimulation with IL-1beta. The activation of the NGAL promoter by transfection of IkappaB-zeta and NF-kappaB was suppressed in C/EBPbeta-depleted cells. Thus IkappaB-zeta acts as an essential transcriptional activator by forming a complex with NF-kappaB on promoters harbouring the NF-kappaB- and C/EBP-binding sites, upon stimulation of TLRs or IL-1 receptor.},

abstract = {Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be important regulators of genes in many organisms and have already been implicated in a growing number of diseases. MiRNAs are short (21-23 nucleotides) RNAs that bind to the 3' untranslated regions of target genes. This binding event causes translational repression of the target gene and, evidence now suggests, also stimulates rapid degradation of the target transcript. miRNAs represent a new species of regulator, controlling the levels of potentially large numbers of proteins, many of which might be important drug targets. The expression of miRNAs shows that they are highly differentially expressed, with specific miRNAs active in certain tissues at certain times. In many cancers, miRNA expression is significantly altered, and this has been shown to be a useful diagnostic tool. Several computational approaches have been developed for the prediction of miRNA targets.},

abstract = {We present a draft sequence of the genome of Aedes aegypti, the primary vector for yellow fever and dengue fever, which at approximately 1376 million base pairs is about 5 times the size of the genome of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. Nearly 50\% of the Ae. aegypti genome consists of transposable elements. These contribute to a factor of approximately 4 to 6 increase in average gene length and in sizes of intergenic regions relative to An. gambiae and Drosophila melanogaster. Nonetheless, chromosomal synteny is generally maintained among all three insects, although conservation of orthologous gene order is higher (by a factor of approximately 2) between the mosquito species than between either of them and the fruit fly. An increase in genes encoding odorant binding, cytochrome P450, and cuticle domains relative to An. gambiae suggests that members of these protein families underpin some of the biological differences between the two mosquito species.},

This project is the first to sequence the genome of a blood-feeding tick vector of human disease and a member of the subphylum Chelicerata. Genome projects for other species of Acari are forthcoming and their genome sequences will likely feature significantly in the future of tick research. Parasitologists interested in advancing the field of tick genomics research will be faced with specific challenges. The development of genetic tools and resources, and the size and repetitive nature of tick genomes are important considerations. Innovative approaches may be required to sequence, assemble, annotate and analyse tick genomes. Overcoming these challenges will enable scientists to investigate the genes and genome organisation of this important group of arthropods and may ultimately lead to new solutions for control of ticks and tick-borne diseases.},

@article{Parthasarathy2007,
abstract = {In insects, especially in mosquitoes that are adult blood feeders, midgut remodeling is an important event during metamorphosis. It involves two processes viz., programmed cell death (PCD) of larval cells, and proliferation and differentiation of imaginal cells to form pupal/adult midgut. These processes are regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH), but the signaling mechanisms, which trigger specific changes remain poorly understood. Here, we report stage- and cell-specific expression of ecydone receptor (EcR), ultraspiracle (USP), broad (Br), E75B and hormone receptor 3 (HR3) during midgut remodeling in Aedes aegypti. In Ae. aegypti both EcR and USP genes code for two isoforms each and the expression of mRNA for these isoforms showed both stage- and cell-specific regulation. In general, EcR-B and USP-A mRNAs were detected during larval stages in larval cells, and EcR-A and USP-B mRNAs were detected during pupal stages in imaginal cells. These data suggest that EcR-B/USP-A heterodimer is important for PCD of larval cells and EcR-A/USP-B heterodimer is important for formation of pupal/adult midgut. Broad Z1 mRNA was detected only in the larval cells suggesting its primary role in PCD. It is likely that E75B and HR3 are probably involved in both PCD and imaginal cell proliferation and differentiation as their mRNAs were expressed in the larval as well as in imaginal cells. Application of JH analog, methoprene, lowered or delayed the expression of all the genes studied. These data suggest that 20E plays a major role in midgut remodeling and coordinates this process through stage- and cell-specific expression of different isoforms of nuclear receptors and transcription factors in the target larval and imaginal cells.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Finding over- or under-represented motifs in biological sequences is now a common task in genomics. Thanks to p-value calculation for motif counts, exceptional motifs are identified and represent candidate functional motifs. The present work addresses the related question of comparing the exceptionality of one motif in two different sequences. Just comparing the motif count p-values in each sequence is indeed not sufficient to decide if this motif is significantly more exceptional in one sequence compared to the other one. A statistical test is required. RESULTS: We develop and analyze two statistical tests, an exact binomial one and an asymptotic likelihood ratio test, to decide whether the exceptionality of a given motif is equivalent or significantly different in two sequences of interest. For that purpose, motif occurrences are modeled by Poisson processes, with a special care for overlapping motifs. Both tests can take the sequence compositions into account. As an illustration, we compare the octamer exceptionalities in the Escherichia coli K-12 backbone versus variable strain-specific loops. CONCLUSION: The exact binomial test is particularly adapted for small counts. For large counts, we advise to use the likelihood ratio test which is asymptotic but strongly correlated with the exact binomial test and very simple to use.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Detection of short, subtle conserved motif regions within a set of related DNA or amino acid sequences can lead to discoveries about important regulatory domains such as transcription factor and DNA binding sites as well as conserved protein domains. In order to help assess motif detection algorithms on motifs with varying properties and levels of conservation, we have developed a computational tool, rMotifGen, with the sole purpose of generating a number of random DNA or protein sequences containing short sequence motifs. Each motif consensus can be user-defined, randomly generated, or created from a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM). Insertions and mutations within these motifs are created according to user-defined parameters and substitution matrices. The resulting sequences can be helpful in mutational simulations and in testing the limits of motif detection algorithms. RESULTS: Two implementations of rMotifGen have been created, one providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for random motif construction, and the other serving as a command line interface. The second implementation has the added advantages of platform independence and being able to be called in a batch mode. rMotifGen was used to construct sample sets of sequences containing DNA motifs and amino acid motifs that were then tested against the Gibbs sampler and MEME packages. CONCLUSION: rMotifGen provides an efficient and convenient method for creating random DNA or amino acid sequences with a variable number of motifs, where the instance of each motif can be incorporated using a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) or by creating an instance mutated from its corresponding consensus using an evolutionary model based on substitution matrices. rMotifGen is freely available at: http://bioinformatics.louisville.edu/brg/rMotifGen/.},

We investigated the role of insulin signaling in the regulation of YPP gene expression. The presence of mosquito insulin receptor (InR) and the Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) in the adult fat body of female mosquitoes was confirmed by means of the RNA interference (RNAi). Fat bodies stimulated with insulin were able to promote the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 Kinase, a key protein of the TOR signaling pathway. Importantly, insulin in combination with 20-hydroxyecdysone activated transcription of the YPP gene vitellogenin (Vg), and this process was sensitive to the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI-3k) inhibitor LY294002 as well as the TOR inhibitor rapamycin. RNAi-mediated knockdown of the mosquito InR, Akt, and TOR inhibited insulin-induced Vg gene expression as well as S6 Kinase phosphorylation in in vitro fat body culture assays.},

We used computational methods to predict miRNAs conserved among Drosophila species and large-scale sequencing of small RNAs from Drosophila melanogaster to experimentally confirm and complement these predictions. In addition to validating 20 of our top 45 predictions for novel miRNA loci, the large-scale sequencing identified many miRNAs that had not been predicted. In total, 59 novel genes were identified, increasing our tally of confirmed fly miRNAs to 148. The large-scale sequencing also refined the identities of previously known miRNAs and provided insights into their biogenesis and expression. Many miRNAs were expressed in particular developmental contexts, with a large cohort of miRNAs expressed primarily in imaginal discs. Conserved miRNAs typically were expressed more broadly and robustly than were nonconserved miRNAs, and those conserved miRNAs with more restricted expression tended to have fewer predicted targets than those expressed more broadly. Predicted targets for the expanded set of microRNAs substantially increased and revised the miRNA-target relationships that appear conserved among the fly species. Insights were also provided into miRNA gene evolution, including evidence for emergent regulatory function deriving from the opposite arm of the miRNA hairpin, exemplified by mir-10, and even the opposite strand of the DNA, exemplified by mir-iab-4.},

We have identified orthologs and paralogs of 245 Drosophila melanogaster immune-related genes in these recently sequenced genomes. Genes encoding effector proteins, and to a lesser extent genes encoding recognition proteins, are much more likely to vary in copy number across species than genes encoding signaling proteins. Furthermore, we can trace the apparent recent origination of several evolutionarily novel immune-related genes and gene families. Using codon-based likelihood methods, we show that immune-system genes, and especially those encoding recognition proteins, evolve under positive darwinian selection. Positively selected sites within recognition proteins cluster in domains involved in recognition of microorganisms, suggesting that molecular interactions between hosts and pathogens may drive adaptive evolution in the Drosophila immune system.},

Each type of functional element shows characteristic patterns of change, or 'evolutionary signatures', dictated by its precise selective constraints. Such signatures enable recognition of new protein-coding genes and exons, spurious and incorrect gene annotations, and numerous unusual gene structures, including abundant stop-codon readthrough. Similarly, we predict non-protein-coding RNA genes and structures, and new microRNA (miRNA) genes. We provide evidence of miRNA processing and functionality from both hairpin arms and both DNA strands. We identify several classes of pre- and post-transcriptional regulatory motifs, and predict individual motif instances with high confidence. We also study how discovery power scales with the divergence and number of species compared, and we provide general guidelines for comparative studies.},

abstract = {X chromosomes evolve differently from autosomes, but general governing principles have not emerged. For example, genes with male-biased expression are under-represented on the X chromosome of D. melanogaster, but are randomly distributed in the genome of Anopheles gambiae. In direct global profiling experiments using species-specific microarrays, we find a nearly identical paucity of genes with male-biased expression on D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. yakuba, D. ananassae, D. virilis and D. mojavensis X chromosomes. We observe the same under-representation on the neo-X of D. pseudoobscura. It has been suggested that precocious meiotic silencing of the X chromosome accounts for reduced X chromosome male-biased expression in nematodes, mammals and Drosophila. We show that X chromosome genes with male-biased expression are under-represented in somatic cells and in mitotic male germ cells. These data are incompatible with simple X chromosome inactivation models. Using expression profiling and comparative sequence analysis, we show that selective gene extinction on the X chromosome, creation of new genes on autosomes and changed genomic location of existing genes contribute to the unusual X chromosome gene content.},

abstract = {Over the last two decades a large number of algorithms has been developed for regulatory motif finding. Here we show how many of these algorithms, especially those that model binding specificities of regulatory factors with position specific weight matrices (WMs), naturally arise within a general Bayesian probabilistic framework. We discuss how WMs are constructed from sets of regulatory sites, how sites for a given WM can be discovered by scanning of large sequences, how to cluster WMs, and more generally how to cluster large sets of sites from different WMs into clusters. We discuss how 'regulatory modules', clusters of sites for subsets of WMs, can be found in large intergenic sequences, and we discuss different methods for ab initio motif finding, including expectation maximization (EM) algorithms, and motif sampling algorithms. Finally, we extensively discuss how module finding methods and ab initio motif finding methods can be extended to take phylogenetic relations between the input sequences into account, i.e. we show how motif finding and phylogenetic footprinting can be integrated in a rigorous probabilistic framework. The article is intended for readers with a solid background in applied mathematics, and preferably with some knowledge of general Bayesian probabilistic methods. The main purpose of the article is to elucidate that all these methods are not a disconnected set of individual algorithmic recipes, but that they are just different facets of a single integrated probabilistic theory.},

In a previous study, 72 actual protein coding regions and their translation initiation sites on the genome of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 were determined by Sazuka et al. using protein two-dimensional electrophoresis and microsequening. In this work, we extracted the sequence patterns surrounding translation initiation sites as HMM using the computer program YEBIS. The constructed HMM could recognize all but one translation initiation site. The HMM contains an AG-rich region (5.7 bp on average), as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence exclusively contains purines, upstream of the translation initiation site (-9.7 position on average) and a CT rich region (4.2 bp on average) just upstream from the translation initiation site. In addition, we found that the second amino acid (-4.5,6) could be classified into two types, one of which had C as their second codon while another of which has a nucleotide distribution relatively similar to the distribution among amino acids in the 72 proteins. This fact corresponds well to our earlier finding that when the second nucleotide of the second amino acid of a translated protein was C, an initial methionine was processed and that otherwise the methionine was intact with high frequency.},

abstract = {We investigated the role of the mosquito broad (br) gene in regulating the 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) effector Vitellogenin (Vg) gene. Injection of double-stranded RNA corresponding to the BR isoform Z2 led to a significant decrease in expression of the Vg gene at 8 and 24h post-blood meal. Knockdown of Z1 or Z4 resulted in enhanced Vg expression beyond its normal expression time. In vitro studies suggested that the effects of BR require its direct binding to the Vg promoter, as well as protein-protein interaction between BR and the ecdysone receptor complex. The BR isoforms are therefore essential for a proper stage-specific biological response to 20E in the adult female mosquito. In particular, the isoform Z2 is required for 20E-mediated activation of Vg, while isoforms Z1 and Z4 serve as repressors to ensure appropriate termination of Vg expression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The most abundant family of insect cuticular proteins, the CPR family, is recognized by the R\&R Consensus, a domain of about 64 amino acids that binds to chitin and is present throughout arthropods. Several species have now been shown to have more than 100 CPR genes, inviting speculation as to the functional importance of this large number and diversity. RESULTS: We have identified 156 genes in Anopheles gambiae that code for putative cuticular proteins in this CPR family, over 1\% of the total number of predicted genes in this species. Annotation was verified using several criteria including identification of TATA boxes, INRs, and DPEs plus support from proteomic and gene expression analyses. Two previously recognized CPR classes, RR-1 and RR-2, form separate, well-supported clades with the exception of a small set of genes with long branches whose relationships are poorly resolved. Several of these outliers have clear orthologs in other species. Although both clades are under purifying selection, the RR-1 variant of the R\&R Consensus is evolving at twice the rate of the RR-2 variant and is structurally more labile. In contrast, the regions flanking the R\&R Consensus have diversified in amino-acid composition to a much greater extent in RR-2 genes compared with RR-1 genes. Many genes are found in compact tandem arrays that may include similar or dissimilar genes but always include just one of the two classes. Tandem arrays of RR-2 genes frequently contain subsets of genes coding for highly similar proteins (sequence clusters). Properties of the proteins indicated that each cluster may serve a distinct function in the cuticle. CONCLUSION: The complete annotation of this large gene family provides insight on the mechanisms of gene family evolution and clues about the need for so many CPR genes. These data also should assist annotation of other Anopheles genes.},

abstract = {Identification of authenticated cuticular proteins has been based on isolation and sequencing of individual proteins extracted from cleaned cuticles. These data facilitated classification of sequences from conceptual translation of cDNA or genomic sequences. The question arises whether such putative cuticular proteins actually are incorporated into the cuticle. This paper describes the profiling of cuticular proteins from Anopheles gambiae starting with cuticle cleaned by the insect itself in the course of molting. Proteins extracted from cast larval head capsules and cast pupal cuticles were fractionated by 1D SDS gel electrophoresis. Large gel slices were reduced, carbamidomethylated and digested with trypsin. The pellet remaining after SDS extraction was also treated with trypsin. The resulting peptides were separated on a C18 column and then analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Two-hundred-ninety-five peptides from putative cuticular proteins were identified; these corresponded to a minimum of 69 and a maximum of 119 different proteins. Each is reported as an authentic Anopheles cuticular protein for the first time. In addition to members of two known cuticular protein families, members of additional families likely to be structural components of the cuticle were identified. Furthermore, other peptides were identified that can be attributed to molting fluid, muscle and sclerotizing agents.},

abstract = {The larval salivary gland of Drosophila melanogaster synthesizes and secretes glue glycoproteins that cement developing animals to a solid surface during metamorphosis. The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) is an essential signaling molecule that modulates most of the physiological functions of the larval gland. At the end of larval development, it is known that 20E--signaling through a nuclear receptor heterodimer consisting of EcR and USP--induces the early and late puffing cascade of the polytene chromosomes and causes the exocytosis of stored glue granules into the lumen of the gland. It has also been reported that an earlier pulse of hormone induces the temporally and spatially specific transcriptional activation of the glue genes; however, the receptor responsible for triggering this response has not been characterized. Here we show that the coordinated expression of the glue genes midway through the third instar is mediated by 20E acting to induce genes of the Broad Complex (BRC) through a receptor that is not an EcR/USP heterodimer. This result is novel because it demonstrates for the first time that at least some 20E-mediated, mid-larval, developmental responses are controlled by an uncharacterized receptor that does not contain an RXR-like component.},

abstract = {Characterizing the DNA-binding specificities of transcription factors is a key problem in computational biology that has been addressed by multiple algorithms. These usually take as input sequences that are putatively bound by the same factor and output one or more DNA motifs. A common practice is to apply several such algorithms simultaneously to improve coverage at the price of redundancy. In interpreting such results, two tasks are crucial: clustering of redundant motifs, and attributing the motifs to transcription factors by retrieval of similar motifs from previously characterized motif libraries. Both tasks inherently involve motif comparison. Here we present a novel method for comparing and merging motifs, based on Bayesian probabilistic principles. This method takes into account both the similarity in positional nucleotide distributions of the two motifs and their dissimilarity to the background distribution. We demonstrate the use of the new comparison method as a basis for motif clustering and retrieval procedures, and compare it to several commonly used alternatives. Our results show that the new method outperforms other available methods in accuracy and sensitivity. We incorporated the resulting motif clustering and retrieval procedures in a large-scale automated pipeline for analyzing DNA motifs. This pipeline integrates the results of various DNA motif discovery algorithms and automatically merges redundant motifs from multiple training sets into a coherent annotated library of motifs. Application of this pipeline to recent genome-wide transcription factor location data in S. cerevisiae successfully identified DNA motifs in a manner that is as good as semi-automated analysis reported in the literature. Moreover, we show how this analysis elucidates the mechanisms of condition-specific preferences of transcription factors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the transcriptional regulation mechanisms in response to environmental challenges is of fundamental importance in biology. Transcription factors associated to response elements and the chromatin structure had proven to play important roles in gene expression regulation. We have analyzed promoter regions of dipteran genes induced in response to immune challenge, in search for particular sequence patterns involved in their transcriptional regulation. RESULTS: 5' upstream regions of D. melanogaster and A. gambiae immunity-induced genes and their corresponding orthologous genes in 11 non-melanogaster drosophilid species and Ae. aegypti share enrichment in AT-rich short motifs. AT-rich motifs are associated with nucleosome formation as predicted by two different algorithms. In A. gambiae and D. melanogaster, many immunity genes 5' upstream sequences also showed NFkappaB response elements, located within 500 bp from the transcription start site. In A. gambiae, the frequency of ATAA motif near the NFkappaB response elements was increased, suggesting a functional link between nucleosome formation/remodelling and NFkappaB regulation of transcription. CONCLUSION: AT-rich motif enrichment in 5' upstream sequences in A. gambiae, Ae. aegypti and the Drosophila genus immunity genes suggests a particular pattern of nucleosome formation/chromatin organization. The co-occurrence of such motifs with the NFkappaB response elements suggests that these sequence signatures may be functionally involved in transcriptional activation during dipteran immune response. AT-rich motif enrichment in regulatory regions in this group of co-regulated genes could represent an evolutionary constrained signature in dipterans and perhaps other distantly species.},

abstract = {The identification of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) can greatly advance our understanding of eukaryotic regulatory mechanism. Current methods to predict CRMs from known motifs either depend on multiple alignments or can only deal with a small number of known motifs provided by users. These methods are problematic when binding sites are not well aligned in multiple alignments or when the number of input known motifs is large. We thus developed a new CRM identification method MOPAT (motif pair tree), which identifies CRMs through the identification of motif modules, groups of motifs co-occurring in multiple CRMs. It can identify 'orthologous' CRMs without multiple alignments. It can also find CRMs given a large number of known motifs. We have applied this method to mouse developmental genes, and have evaluated the predicted CRMs and motif modules by microarray expression data and known interacting motif pairs. We show that the expression profiles of the genes containing CRMs of the same motif module correlate significantly better than those of a random set of genes do. We also show that the known interacting motif pairs are significantly included in our predictions. Compared with several current methods, our method shows better performance in identifying meaningful CRMs.},

abstract = {A fundamental function of the visual system is to encode the building blocks of natural scenes-edges, textures and shapes-that subserve visual tasks such as object recognition and scene understanding. Essential to this process is the formation of abstract representations that generalize from specific instances of visual input. A common view holds that neurons in the early visual system signal conjunctions of image features, but how these produce invariant representations is poorly understood. Here we propose that to generalize over similar images, higher-level visual neurons encode statistical variations that characterize local image regions. We present a model in which neural activity encodes the probability distribution most consistent with a given image. Trained on natural images, the model generalizes by learning a compact set of dictionary elements for image distributions typically encountered in natural scenes. Model neurons show a diverse range of properties observed in cortical cells. These results provide a new functional explanation for nonlinear effects in complex cells and offer insight into coding strategies in primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Computational discovery of regulatory elements is an important area of bioinformatics research and more than a hundred motif discovery methods have been published. Traditionally, most of these methods have addressed the problem of single motif discovery - discovering binding motifs for individual transcription factors. In higher organisms, however, transcription factors usually act in combination with nearby bound factors to induce specific regulatory behaviours. Hence, recent focus has shifted from single motifs to the discovery of sets of motifs bound by multiple cooperating transcription factors, so called composite motifs or cis-regulatory modules. Given the large number and diversity of methods available, independent assessment of methods becomes important. Although there have been several benchmark studies of single motif discovery, no similar studies have previously been conducted concerning composite motif discovery. RESULTS: We have developed a benchmarking framework for composite motif discovery and used it to evaluate the performance of eight published module discovery tools. Benchmark datasets were constructed based on real genomic sequences containing experimentally verified regulatory modules, and the module discovery programs were asked to predict both the locations of these modules and to specify the single motifs involved. To aid the programs in their search, we provided position weight matrices corresponding to the binding motifs of the transcription factors involved. In addition, selections of decoy matrices were mixed with the genuine matrices on one dataset to test the response of programs to varying levels of noise. CONCLUSION: Although some of the methods tested tended to score somewhat better than others overall, there were still large variations between individual datasets and no single method performed consistently better than the rest in all situations. The variation in performance on individual datasets also shows that the new benchmark datasets represents a suitable variety of challenges to most methods for module discovery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The challenges of accurate gene prediction and enumeration are further aggravated in large genomes that contain highly repetitive transposable elements (TEs). Yet TEs play a substantial role in genome evolution and are themselves an important subject of study. Repeat annotation, based on counting occurrences of k-mers, has been previously used to distinguish TEs from low-copy genic regions; but currently available software solutions are impractical due to high memory requirements or specialization for specific user-tasks. RESULTS: Here we introduce the Tallymer software, a flexible and memory-efficient collection of programs for k-mer counting and indexing of large sequence sets. Unlike previous methods, Tallymer is based on enhanced suffix arrays. This gives a much larger flexibility concerning the choice of the k-mer size. Tallymer can process large data sizes of several billion bases. We used it in a variety of applications to study the genomes of maize and other plant species. In particular, Tallymer was used to index a set of whole genome shotgun sequences from maize (B73) (total size 109 bp.). We analyzed k-mer frequencies for a wide range of k. At this low genome coverage ( approximately 0.45x) highly repetitive 20-mers constituted 44\% of the genome but represented only 1\% of all possible k-mers. Similar low-complexity was seen in the repeat fractions of sorghum and rice. When applying our method to other maize data sets, High-C0t derived sequences showed the greatest enrichment for low-copy sequences. Among annotated TEs, the most highly repetitive were of the Ty3/gypsy class of retrotransposons, followed by the Ty1/copia class, and DNA transposons. Among expressed sequence tags (EST), a notable fraction contained high-copy k-mers, suggesting that transposons are still active in maize. Retrotransposons in Mo17 and McC cultivars were readily detected using the B73 20-mer frequency index, indicating their conservation despite extensive rearrangement across cultivars. Among one hundred annotated bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), k-mer frequency could be used to detect transposon-encoded genes with 92\% sensitivity, compared to 96\% using alignment-based repeat masking, while both methods showed 92\% specificity. CONCLUSION: The Tallymer software was effective in a variety of applications to aid genome annotation in maize, despite limitations imposed by the relatively low coverage of sequence available.

Its physiological importance in food protein digestion in several invertebrate species has emerged with compelling evidence; and several other physiological functions, such as regulation of digestive functions, are now settled. Recent advances in the knowledge of invertebrate trypsin synthesis, regulation, genetics, catalytic characteristics; structure, evolution, as well as inhibition, especially in non-Drosophilidae insects and in some crustaceans are reviewed.

@article{Polavarapu2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The majority of human non-protein-coding DNA is made up of repetitive sequences, mainly transposable elements (TEs). It is becoming increasingly apparent that many of these repetitive DNA sequence elements encode gene regulatory functions. This fact has important evolutionary implications, since repetitive DNA is the most dynamic part of the genome. We set out to assess the evolutionary rate and pattern of experimentally characterized human transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) that are derived from repetitive versus non-repetitive DNA to test whether repeat-derived TFBS are in fact rapidly evolving. We also evaluated the position-specific patterns of variation among TFBS to look for signs of functional constraint on TFBS derived from repetitive and non-repetitive DNA. RESULTS: We found numerous experimentally characterized TFBS in the human genome, 7-10\% of all mapped sites, which are derived from repetitive DNA sequences including simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and TEs. TE-derived TFBS sequences are far less conserved between species than TFBS derived from SSRs and non-repetitive DNA. Despite their rapid evolution, several lines of evidence indicate that TE-derived TFBS are functionally constrained. First of all, ancient TE families, such as MIR and L2, are enriched for TFBS relative to younger families like Alu and L1. Secondly, functionally important positions in TE-derived TFBS, specifically those residues thought to physically interact with their cognate protein binding factors (TF), are more evolutionarily conserved than adjacent TFBS positions. Finally, TE-derived TFBS show position-specific patterns of sequence variation that are highly distinct from random patterns and similar to the variation seen for non-repeat derived sequences of the same TFBS. CONCLUSION: The abundance of experimentally characterized human TFBS that are derived from repetitive DNA speaks to the substantial regulatory effects that this class of sequence has on the human genome. The unique evolutionary properties of repeat-derived TFBS are perhaps even more intriguing. TE-derived TFBS in particular, while clearly functionally constrained, evolve extremely rapidly relative to non-repeat derived sites. Such rapidly evolving TFBS are likely to confer species-specific regulatory phenotypes, i.e. divergent expression patterns, on the human evolutionary lineage. This result has practical implications with respect to the widespread use of evolutionary conservation as a surrogate for functionally relevant non-coding DNA. Most TE-derived TFBS would be missed using the kinds of sequence conservation-based screens, such as phylogenetic footprinting, that are used to help characterize non-coding DNA. Thus, the very TFBS that are most likely to yield human-specific characteristics will be neglected by the comparative genomic techniques that are currently de rigeur for the identification of novel regulatory sites.},

For many applications it is desirable to restrict the display of such annotation according to a score cutoff, as biological interpretation can be difficult in the presence of the entire data. Unfortunately, many visualisation solutions are somewhat static in the way they handle such score cutoffs. RESULTS: We present BioSAVE, a sequence annotation viewer with on-the-fly selection of visualisation thresholds for each feature. BioSAVE is a versatile OS X program for visual display of scored features (annotation) within a sequence context. The program reads sequence and additional supplementary annotation data (e.g., position weight matrix matches, conservation scores, structural domains) from a variety of commonly used file formats and displays them graphically. Onscreen controls then allow for live customisation of these graphics, including on-the-fly selection of visualisation thresholds for each feature. CONCLUSION: Possible applications of the program include display of transcription factor binding sites in a genomic context or the visualisation of structural domain assignments in protein sequences and many more. The dynamic visualisation of these annotations is useful, e.g., for the determination of cutoff values of predicted features to match experimental data.

abstract = {Functional turnover of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), such as whole-motif loss or gain, are common events during genome evolution. Conventional probabilistic phylogenetic shadowing methods model the evolution of genomes only at nucleotide level, and lack the ability to capture the evolutionary dynamics of functional turnover of aligned sequence entities. As a result, comparative genomic search of non-conserved motifs across evolutionarily related taxa remains a difficult challenge, especially in higher eukaryotes, where the cis-regulatory regions containing motifs can be long and divergent; existing methods rely heavily on specialized pattern-driven heuristic search or sampling algorithms, which can be difficult to generalize and hard to interpret based on phylogenetic principles. We propose a new method: Conditional Shadowing via Multi-resolution Evolutionary Trees, or CSMET, which uses a context-dependent probabilistic graphical model that allows aligned sites from different taxa in a multiple alignment to be modeled by either a background or an appropriate motif phylogeny conditioning on the functional specifications of each taxon. The functional specifications themselves are the output of a phylogeny which models the evolution not of individual nucleotides, but of the overall functionality (e.g., functional retention or loss) of the aligned sequence segments over lineages. Combining this method with a hidden Markov model that autocorrelates evolutionary rates on successive sites in the genome, CSMET offers a principled way to take into consideration lineage-specific evolution of TFBSs during motif detection, and a readily computable analytical form of the posterior distribution of motifs under TFBS turnover. On both simulated and real Drosophila cis-regulatory modules, CSMET outperforms other state-of-the-art comparative genomic motif finders.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The computation of the statistical properties of motif occurrences has an obviously relevant application: patterns that are significantly over- or under-represented in genomes or proteins are interesting candidates for biological roles. However, the problem is computationally hard; as a result, virtually all the existing motif finders use fast but approximate scoring functions, in spite of the fact that they have been shown to produce systematically incorrect results. A few interesting exact approaches are known, but they are very slow and hence not practical in the case of realistic sequences. RESULTS: We give an exact solution, solely based on deterministic finite-state automata (DFA), to the problem of finding the whole relevant part of the probability distribution function of a simple-word motif in a homogeneous (biological) sequence. Out of that, the z-value can always be computed, while the P-value can be obtained either when it is not too extreme with respect to the number of floating-point digits available in the implementation, or when the number of pattern occurrences is moderately low. In particular, the time complexity of the algorithms for Markov models of moderate order (0 < or = m < or = 2) is far better than that of Nuel, which was the fastest similar exact algorithm known to date; in many cases, even approximate methods are outperformed. CONCLUSIONS: DFA are a standard tool of computer science for the study of patterns; previous works in biology propose algorithms involving automata, but there they are used, respectively, as a first step to write a generating function, or to build a finite Markov-chain imbedding (FMCI). In contrast, we directly rely on DFA to perform the calculations; thus we manage to obtain an algorithm which is both easily interpretable and efficient. This approach can be used for exact statistical studies of very long genomes and protein sequences, as we illustrate with some examples on the scale of the human genome.},

abstract = {Anautogenous mosquitoes require blood meals to promote egg development. If adequate nutrients are not obtained during larval development, the resulting "small" sized adult mosquitoes require multiple blood meals for egg development; markedly increasing host-vector contacts and the likelihood of disease transmission. Nutrient-sensitive target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling is a key signaling pathway that links elevated hemolymph amino acid levels derived from the blood meal to the expression of yolk protein precursors in the fat body. Here we report that the blood-meal-induced activation of the TOR-signaling pathway and subsequent egg maturation depends on the accumulation of adequate nutritional reserves during larval development. We have established well-nourished, "standard" mosquitoes and malnourished, "small" mosquitoes as models to address this nutrient sensitive pathway. This regulatory mechanism involves juvenile hormone (JH), which acts as a mediator of fat body competence, permitting the response to amino acids derived from the blood meal. We demonstrate that treatment with JH results in recovery of the TOR molecular machinery, Aedes aegypti cationic amino acid transporter 2 (AaiCAT2), TOR, and S6 kinase (S6K), in fat bodies of small mosquitoes, enabling them to complete their first gonotrophic cycle after a single blood meal. These findings establish a direct link between nutrient reserves and the establishment of TOR signaling in mosquitoes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evolutionary conservation has been used successfully to help identify cis-acting DNA regions that are important in regulating tissue-specific gene expression. Motivated by increasing evidence that some DNA regulatory regions are not evolutionary conserved, we have developed an approach for cis-regulatory region identification that does not rely upon evolutionary sequence conservation. RESULTS: The conservation-independent approach is based on an empirical potential energy between interacting transcription factors (TFs). In this analysis, the potential energy is defined as a function of the number of TF interactions in a genomic region and the strength of the interactions. By identifying sets of interacting TFs, the analysis locates regions enriched with the binding sites of these interacting TFs. We applied this approach to 30 human tissues and identified 6232 putative cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) regulating 2130 tissue-specific genes. Interestingly, some genes appear to be regulated by different CRMs in different tissues. Known regulatory regions are highly enriched in our predicted CRMs. In addition, DNase I hypersensitive sites, which tend to be associated with active regulatory regions, significantly overlap with the predicted CRMs, but not with more conserved regions. We also find that conserved and non-conserved CRMs regulate distinct gene groups. Conserved CRMs control more essential genes and genes involved in fundamental cellular activities such as transcription. In contrast, non-conserved CRMs, in general, regulate more non-essential genes, such as genes related to neural activity. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that identifying relevant sets of binding motifs can help in the mapping of DNA regulatory regions, and suggest that non-conserved CRMs play an important role in gene regulation.},

abstract = {CPR proteins are the largest cuticular protein family in arthropods. The whole genome sequence of Anopheles gambiae revealed 156 genes that code for proteins with the R\&R Consensus and named CPRs. This protein family can be divided into RR-1 and RR-2 subgroups, postulated to contribute to different regions of the cuticle. We determined the temporal expression patterns of these genes throughout post-embryonic development by means of real-time qRT-PCR. Based on expression profiles, these genes were grouped into 21 clusters. Most of the genes were expressed with sharp peaks at single or multiple periods associated with molting. Genes coding for RR-1 and RR-2 proteins were found together in several co-expression clusters. Twenty-five genes were expressed exclusively at one metamorphic stage. Five out of six X-linked genes showed equal expression in males and females, supporting the presence of a gene dosage compensation system in A. gambiae. Many RR-2 genes are organized into sequence clusters whose members are extremely similar to each other and generally closely associated on a chromosome. Most genes in each sequence cluster are expressed with the same temporal expression pattern and at the same level, suggesting a shared mechanism to regulate their expression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the mosquito Aedes aegypti the insulin/insulin growth factor I signaling (IIS) cascade is a key regulator of many physiological processes, including reproduction. Two important reproductive events, steroidogenesis in the ovary and yolk synthesis in the fat body, are regulated by the IIS cascade in mosquitoes. The signaling molecule phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a key inhibitor of the IIS cascade that helps modulate the activity of the IIS cascade. In Ae. aegypti, six unique splice variants of AaegPTEN were previously identified, but the role of these splice variants, particularly AaegPTEN3 and 6, were unknown. RESULTS: Knockdown of AaegPTEN or its specific splice variant AaegPTEN6 (the splice variant thought to regulate reproduction in the ovary and fat body) using RNAi led to a 15-63\% increase in egg production with no adverse effects on egg viability during the first reproductive cycle. Knockdown of AaegPTEN3, expressed predominantly in the head, had no effect on reproduction. We also characterized the protein expression patterns of these two splice variants during development and in various tissues during a reproductive cycle. CONCLUSION: Previous studies in a range of organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, have demonstrated that disruption of the IIS cascade leads to decreased reproduction or sterility. In this study we demonstrate that knockdown of the IIS inhibitor PTEN can actually increase reproduction in the mosquito, at least during the first reproductive cycle.},

abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is the development of different phenotypes from a single genotype, depending on the environment. Such plasticity is a pervasive feature of life, is observed for various traits and is often argued to be the result of natural selection. A thorough study of phenotypic plasticity should thus include an ecological and an evolutionary perspective. Recent advances in large-scale gene expression technology make it possible to also study plasticity from a molecular perspective, and the addition of these data will help answer long-standing questions about this widespread phenomenon. In this review, we present examples of integrative studies that illustrate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying plastic traits, and show how new techniques will grow in importance in the study of these plastic molecular processes. These techniques include: (i) heterologous hybridization to DNA microarrays; (ii) next generation sequencing technologies applied to transcriptomics; (iii) techniques for studying the function of noncoding small RNAs; and (iv) proteomic tools. We also present recent studies on genetic model systems that uncover how environmental cues triggering different plastic responses are sensed and integrated by the organism. Finally, we describe recent work on changes in gene expression in response to an environmental cue that persist after the cue is removed. Such long-term responses are made possible by epigenetic molecular mechanisms, including DNA methylation. The results of these current studies help us outline future avenues for the study of plasticity.},

Gambif1 protein is translocated to the nucleus in fat body cells in response to bacterial challenge, although the mRNA is present at low levels at all developmental stages and is not induced by infection. DNA binding activity to the kappaB-like sites in the A.gambiae Defensin and the Drosophila Diptericin and Cecropin promoters is also induced in larval nuclear extracts following infection. Gambif1 has the ability to bind to kappaB-like sites in vitro. Co-transfection assays in Drosophila mbn-2 cells show that Gambif1 can activate transcription by interacting with the Drosophila Diptericin regulatory elements, but is not functionally equivalent to Dorsal in this assay. Gambif1 protein translocation to the nucleus and the appearance of kappaB-like DNA binding activity can serve as molecular markers of activation of the immune system and open up the possibility of studying the role of defence reactions in determining mosquito susceptibility/refractoriness to malaria infection.},

abstract = {Ecdysteroids and juvenile hormones (JH) regulate a variety of developmental, physiological, behavioral, and metabolic processes. Ecdysteroids function through a heterodimeric complex of two nuclear receptors, ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle (USP). An 85 kDa protein identified in Drosophila melanogaster methoprene-tolerant (Met) mutant binds to JH III with high affinity, and the mutant flies are resistant to juvenile hormone analog (JHA), methoprene. Reporter assays using the yeast two-hybrid system were performed in order to study the molecular interactions between EcR, USP and Met. As expected, EcR fused to the B42 activation domain and USP fused to the LexA DNA binding domain interacted with each other and supported induction of the reporter gene in the presence of stable ecdysteroid analog, RG-102240 or steroids, muristerone A and ponasterone A. The USP:USP homodimers supported expression of the reporter gene in the absence of ligand, and there was no significant increase in the reporter activity after addition of a JHA, methoprene. Similarly, Met:Met homodimers as well as Met:EcR and Met:USP heterodimers induced reporter activity in the absence of ligand and addition of ecdysteroid or JH analogs did not increase the reporter activity regulated by either homodimers or heterodimers of Met protein. Two-hybrid assays in insect cells and in vitro pull-down assays confirmed the interaction of Met with EcR and USP. These data suggest that the proteins that are involved in signal transduction of ecdysteroids (EcR and USP) and juvenile hormones (Met) interact to mediate cross-talk between these two important hormones.

RESULTS: Consequently, we compared full length cDNA sequencing to 2-channel gene expression microarrays in the context of measuring differential gene expression. Because of its comparable cost to a gene expression microarray, our study focused on the data obtainable from a single lane of an Illumina 1 G sequencer. We compared sequencing data to a highly replicated microarray experiment profiling two divergent strains of S. cerevisiae. CONCLUSION: Using a large number of quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays, more than previous studies, we found that neither technology is decisively better at measuring differential gene expression. Further, we report sequencing results from a diploid hybrid of two strains of S. cerevisiae that indicate full length cDNA sequencing can discover heterozygosity and measure quantitative allele-specific expression simultaneously.},

A weighed voting technique is going to be used to improve the prediction of the number of clusters based on different data mining techniques. These tools may be used for the identification of new tumour classes using DNA microarray datasets. This estimation approach may perform a useful tool to support biological and biomedical knowledge discovery. METHODS: Three clustering and two validation algorithms were applied to two cancer tumor datasets. Recent studies confirm that there is no universal pattern recognition and clustering model to predict molecular profiles across different datasets. Thus, it is useful not to rely on one single clustering or validation method, but to apply a variety of approaches. Therefore, combination of these methods may be successfully used for the estimation of the number of clusters. RESULTS: The methods implemented in this research may contribute to the validation of clustering results and the estimation of the number of clusters. The results show that this estimation approach may represent an effective tool to support biomedical knowledge discovery and healthcare applications.

We analyzed, from an evolutionary perspective, the binding regions of seven mammalian transcription factors (ESR1, TP53, MYC, RELA, POU5F1, SOX2, and CTCF) identified on a genome-wide scale by different chromatin immunoprecipitation approaches and found that only a minority of sites appear to be conserved at the sequence level. Instead, we uncovered a pervasive association with genomic repeats by showing that a large fraction of the bona fide binding sites for five of the seven transcription factors (ESR1, TP53, POU5F1, SOX2, and CTCF) are embedded in distinctive families of transposable elements. Using the age of the repeats, we established that these repeat-associated binding sites (RABS) have been associated with significant regulatory expansions throughout the mammalian phylogeny. We validated the functional significance of these RABS by showing that they are over-represented in proximity of regulated genes and that the binding motifs within these repeats have undergone evolutionary selection. Our results demonstrate that transcriptional regulatory networks are highly dynamic in eukaryotic genomes and that transposable elements play an important role in expanding the repertoire of binding sites.},

Statistical and computational methods are key for drawing meaningful and accurate conclusions from the massive and complex datasets generated by the sequencers. We provide a detailed evaluation of statistical methods for normalization and differential expression (DE) analysis of Illumina transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-Seq) data. Results: We compare statistical methods for detecting genes that are significantly DE between two types of biological samples and find that there are substantial differences in how the test statistics handle low-count genes. We evaluate how DE results are affected by features of the sequencing platform, such as, varying gene lengths, base-calling calibration method (with and without phi X control lane), and flow-cell/library preparation effects. We investigate the impact of the read count normalization method on DE results and show that the standard approach of scaling by total lane counts (e.g., RPKM) can bias estimates of DE. We propose more general quantile-based normalization procedures and demonstrate an improvement in DE detection. Conclusions: Our results have significant practical and methodological implications for the design and analysis of mRNA-Seq experiments. They highlight the importance of appropriate statistical methods for normalization and DE inference, to account for features of the sequencing platform that could impact the accuracy of results. They also reveal the need for further research in the development of statistical and computational methods for mRNA-Seq.},

MIQE is a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating qPCR experiments. Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is necessary to enable other investigators to reproduce results. MIQE details should be published either in abbreviated form or as an online supplement.

abstract = {Dorsoventral (DV) patterning of the Drosophila embryo is controlled by a concentration gradient of Dorsal, a sequence-specific transcription factor related to mammalian NF-kappaB. The Dorsal gradient generates at least 3 distinct thresholds of gene activity and tissue specification by the differential regulation of target enhancers containing distinctive combinations of binding sites for Dorsal, Twist, Snail, and other DV determinants. To understand the evolution of DV patterning mechanisms, we identified and characterized Dorsal target enhancers from the mosquito Anopheles gambiae and the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. Putative orthologous enhancers are located in similar positions relative to the target genes they control, even though they lack sequence conservation and sometimes produce divergent patterns of gene expression. The most dramatic example of this conservation is seen for the "shadow" enhancer regulating brinker: It is conserved within the intron of the neighboring Atg5 locus of both flies and mosquitoes. These results suggest that, like exons, an enhancer position might be subject to constraint. Thus, novel patterns of gene expression might arise from the modification of conserved enhancers rather than the invention of new ones. We propose that this enhancer constancy might be a general property of regulatory evolution, and should facilitate enhancer discovery in nonmodel organisms.},

abstract = {A speciation process is ongoing in the primary vector of malaria in Africa, Anopheles gambiae. Assortatively mating incipient species known as the M and S forms differentially exploit larval breeding sites associated with different ecological settings. However, some ongoing gene flow between M and S limits significant genomic differentiation mainly to small centromere-proximal regions on chromosomes X and 2L, termed 'speciation islands' with the expectation that they contain the genes responsible for reproductive isolation. As the speciation islands exhibit reduced recombination and low polymorphism, more detailed genetic analysis using fine-scale mapping is impractical. We measured global gene expression differences between M and S using oligonucleotide microarrays, with the goal of identifying candidate genes that could be involved in this ongoing speciation process. Gene expression profiles were examined in two independent colonies of both forms at each of three developmental periods of interest: fourth instar larvae, virgin females, and gravid females. Patterns were validated on a subset of genes using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of RNA samples from laboratory colonies and wild mosquitoes collected from Cameroon and Burkina Faso. Considered across all three developmental periods, differentially expressed genes represented approximately 1-2\% of all expressed genes. Although disproportionately represented in the X speciation island, the vast majority of genes were located outside any speciation island. Compared to samples from the other developmental periods, virgin females were characterized by more than twice as many differentially expressed genes, most notably those implicated in olfaction and potentially, mate recognition.},

abstract = {Short directly-repeated (DR) DNA enhancer elements of plant viral origin were analyzed for their ability, both individually and in combination, to influence in vivo transcription when inserted upstream from a minimal CaMV35S promoter. Synthetic promoters containing multiple copies and/or combinations of DR cassettes were tested for their effect upon reporter gene (luciferase) expression using an Agrobacteria-based leaf-infiltration transient assay and within stably transformed plants (Nicotiana tabacum). Transgenic plants harboring constructs containing different numbers or combinations of DR cassettes were further tested to look for tissue-specific expression patterns and potential promoter response to the infiltration process employed during transient expression. Multimerization of DR elements produced enhancer activity that was in general additive, increasing reporter activity in direct proportion to the number of DR cassettes within the test promoter. In contrast, combinations of different DR cassettes often functioned synergistically, producing reporter enhancement markedly greater then the sum of the combined DR activities. Several of the DR constructs responded to Agrobacteria (lacking T-DNA) infiltration of transgenic leaves by an induction (2 elements) or reduction (1 element) in reporter activity. Combinations of DR cassettes producing the strongest enhancement of reporter activity were used to create two synthetic promoters (SynPro3 and SynPro5) that drive leaf reporter activities at levels comparable to the CaMV35S promoter. Characterization of these synthetic promoters in transformed tobacco showed strong reporter expression at all stages of development and in most tissues. The arrangement of DR elements within SynPro3 and SynPro5 appears to play a role in defining tissue-specificity of expression and/or Agrobacteria-infusion responsiveness.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The regulation of gene expression is complex and occurs at many levels, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional, in metazoans. Transcriptional regulation is mainly determined by sequence elements within the promoter regions of genes while sequence elements within the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs play important roles in post-transcriptional regulation such as mRNA stability and translation efficiency. Identifying cis-regulatory elements, or motifs, in multicellular eukaryotes is more difficult compared to unicellular eukaryotes due to the larger intergenic sequence space and the increased complexity in regulation. Experimental techniques for discovering functional elements are often time consuming and not easily applied on a genome level. Consequently, computational methods are advantageous for genome-wide cis-regulatory motif detection. To decrease the search space in metazoans, many algorithms use cross-species alignment, although studies have demonstrated that a large portion of the binding sites for the same trans-acting factor do not reside in alignable regions. Therefore, a computational algorithm should account for both conserved and nonconserved cis-regulatory elements in metazoans. RESULTS: We present CompMoby (Comparative MobyDick), software developed to identify cis-regulatory binding sites at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in metazoans without prior knowledge of the trans-acting factors. The CompMoby algorithm was previously shown to identify cis-regulatory binding sites in upstream regions of genes co-regulated in embryonic stem cells. In this paper, we extend the software to identify putative cis-regulatory motifs in 3' UTR sequences and verify our results using experimentally validated data sets in mouse and human. We also detail the implementation of CompMoby into a user-friendly tool that includes a web interface to a streamlined analysis. Our software allows detection of motifs in the following three categories: one, those that are alignable and conserved; two, those that are conserved but not alignable; three, those that are species specific. One of the output files from CompMoby gives the user the option to decide what category of cis-regulatory element to experimentally pursue based on their biological problem. Using experimentally validated biological datasets, we demonstrate that CompMoby is successful in detecting cis-regulatory target sites of known and novel trans-acting factors at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. CONCLUSION: CompMoby is a powerful software tool for systematic de novo discovery of evolutionarily conserved and nonconserved cis-regulatory sequences involved in transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation in metazoans.

abstract = {Summary. Transcription factors bind sequence-specific sites in DNA to regulate gene transcription. Identifying transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is an important step for understanding gene regulation. Although sophisticated in modeling TFBSs and their combinatorial patterns, computational methods for TFBS detection and motif finding often make oversimplified homogeneous model assumptions for background sequences. Since nucleotide base composition varies across genomic regions, it is expected to be helpful for motif finding to incorporate the heterogeneity into background modeling. When sequences from multiple species are utilized, variation in evolutionary conservation violates the common assumption of an identical conservation level in multiple alignments. To handle both types of heterogeneity, we propose a generative model in which a segmented Markov chain is used to partition a multiple alignment into regions of homogeneous nucleotide base composition and a hidden Markov model (HMM) is employed to account for different conservation levels. Bayesian inference on the model is developed via Gibbs sampling with dynamic programming recursions. Simulation studies and empirical evidence from biological data sets reveal the dramatic effect of background modeling on motif finding, and demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to achieve substantial improvements over commonly used background models.},

abstract = {In anautogenous mosquitoes, egg development requires blood feeding and as a consequence mosquitoes act as vectors of numerous devastating diseases of humans and domestic animals. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating mosquito egg development may contribute significantly to the development of novel vector-control strategies. Previous studies have shown that in the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti, nuclear receptors (NRs) play a key role in the endocrine regulation of reproduction. However, many mosquito NRs remain uncharacterized, some of which may play an important role in mosquito reproduction. Publication of the genome of A. aegypti allowed us to identify all NRs in this mosquito based on their phylogenetic relatedness to those within Insecta. We have determined that there are 20 putative A. aegypti NRs, some of which are predicted to have different isoforms. As the first step toward analysis of this gene family, we have established their expression within the two main reproductive tissues of adult female mosquitoes: fat body and ovary. All NR transcripts are present in both tissues, most displaying dynamic expression profiles during reproductive cycles. Finally, in vitro assays with isolated fat bodies were conducted to identify the role of the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone in modulating the expression of A. aegypti NRs. These data which describe the identification, expression and hormonal regulation of 20 NRs in the yellow fever mosquito lay a solid foundation for future studies on the hormonal regulation of reproduction in mosquitoes.},

@article{Cunningham1993,
abstract = {Induced expression of the allantoin (DAL) catabolic genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been suggested to be mediated by interaction of three different types of promoter elements. First is an inducer-independent upstream activation sequence, UASNTR, whose operation is sensitive to nitrogen catabolite repression. The GLN3 product is required for UASNTR-mediated transcriptional activation. This site consists of two separated elements, each of which has a GATAA sequence at its core. Response of the DAL genes to inducer is mediated by a second type of cis-acting element, DAL UIS. The DAL82 and DAL81 genes are required for response to inducer; DAL82 protein is the UIS-binding protein. When only the UASNTR and UIS elements are present, DAL gene expression occurs at high levels in the absence of inducer. We, therefore, hypothesized that a third element, an upstream repressor sequence (URS) mediates maintenance of DAL gene expression at a low level when inducer is absent. Since the DAL and UGA genes are overexpressed and largely inducer independent in dal80 deletion mutants, we have suggested DAL80 protein negatively regulates a wide spectrum of nitrogen-catabolic gene expression, likely in conjunction with a URS element. Here we show that DAL80 protein binds to DAL3 and UGA4 upstream DNA sequences, designated URSGATA, consisting of two GATAA-containing sites separated by at least 15 bp. The preferred orientation of the sites is tail to tail, but reasonable binding activity is also observed with a head-to-tail configuration. URSGATA elements contain the sequence GATAA at their core and hence share sequence homology with UASNTR elements.},

The Evi-1 gene encodes a 145-kDa DNA-binding protein containing two domains of seven and three Cys2-His2 zinc fingers. Previous studies identified a portion of the consensus DNA-binding sequence for the first domain of zinc fingers. The experiments presented here extend these studies and demonstrate that the first domain recognizes a consensus of 15 nucleotides consisting of GA(C/T)AAGA(T/C)AAGATAA. The first three fingers of the first domain do not detectably bind DNA but contribute to the binding by conferring a relative specificity for GACAA verses GATAA in the first position. The first three fingers also contribute to optimal binding of the 15-nucleotide consensus sequence.},

This naturally acquired microbial flora can modulate the mosquito's vectorial capacity by inhibiting the development of Plasmodium and other human pathogens through an unknown mechanism. We have undertaken a comprehensive functional genomic approach to elucidate the molecular interplay between the bacterial co-infection and the development of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in its natural vector Anopheles gambiae. Global transcription profiling of septic and aseptic mosquitoes identified a significant subset of immune genes that were mostly up-regulated by the mosquito's microbial flora, including several anti-Plasmodium factors. Microbe-free aseptic mosquitoes displayed an increased susceptibility to Plasmodium infection while co-feeding mosquitoes with bacteria and P. falciparum gametocytes resulted in lower than normal infection levels. Infection analyses suggest the bacteria-mediated anti-Plasmodium effect is mediated by the mosquitoes' antimicrobial immune responses, plausibly through activation of basal immunity. We show that the microbiota can modulate the anti-Plasmodium effects of some immune genes. In sum, the microbiota plays an essential role in modulating the mosquito's capacity to sustain Plasmodium infection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Changes in gene regulation are suspected to comprise one of the driving forces for evolution. To address the extent of cis-regulatory changes and how they impact on gene regulatory networks across eukaryotes, we systematically analyzed the evolutionary dynamics of target gene batteries controlled by 16 different transcription factors. RESULTS: We found that gene batteries show variable conservation within vertebrates, with slow and fast evolving modules. Hence, while a key gene battery associated with the cell cycle is conserved throughout metazoans, the POU5F1 (Oct4) and SOX2 batteries in embryonic stem cells show strong conservation within mammals, with the striking exception of rodents. Within the genes composing a given gene battery, we could identify a conserved core that likely reflects the ancestral function of the corresponding transcription factor. Interestingly, we show that the association between a transcription factor and its target genes is conserved even when we exclude conserved sequence similarities of their promoter regions from our analysis. This supports the idea that turnover, either of the transcription factor binding site or its direct neighboring sequence, is a pervasive feature of proximal regulatory sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals the dynamics of evolutionary changes within metazoan gene networks, including both the composition of gene batteries and the architecture of target gene promoters. This variation provides the playground required for evolutionary innovation around conserved ancestral core functions.},

RESULTS: We have used a discriminative seeding DNA motif discovery algorithm for an in-depth analysis of 54 seed storage protein (SSP) gene promoters from three plant families, namely Brassicaceae (mustards), Fabaceae (legumes) and Poaceae (grasses) using backgrounds based on complete sets of promoters from a representative species in each family, namely Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.), soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) respectively. We have identified three conserved motifs (two RY-like and one ACGT-like) in Brassicaceae and Fabaceae SSP gene promoters that are similar to experimentally characterized seed-specific cis-regulatory elements. Fabaceae SSP gene promoter sequences are also enriched in a novel, seed-specific E2Fb-like motif. Conserved motifs identified in Poaceae SSP gene promoters include a GCN4-like motif, two prolamin-box-like motifs and an Skn-1-like motif. Evidence of the presence of a variant of the TATA-box is found in the SSP gene promoters from the three plant families. Motifs discovered in SSP gene promoters were used to score whole-genome sets of promoters from Arabidopsis, soybean and rice. The highest-scoring promoters are associated with genes coding for different subunits or precursors of seed storage proteins. CONCLUSION: Seed storage protein gene promoter motifs are conserved in diverse species, and different plant families are characterized by a distinct combination of conserved motifs. The majority of discovered motifs match experimentally characterized cis-regulatory elements. These results provide a good starting point for further experimental analysis of plant seed-specific promoters and our methodology can be used to unravel more transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in plants and other eukaryotes.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous RNAs that pair to sites in mRNAs to direct post-transcriptional repression. Many sites that match the miRNA seed (nucleotides 2-7), particularly those in 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs), are preferentially conserved. Here, we overhauled our tool for finding preferential conservation of sequence motifs and applied it to the analysis of human 3'UTRs, increasing by nearly threefold the detected number of preferentially conserved miRNA target sites. The new tool more efficiently incorporates new genomes and more completely controls for background conservation by accounting for mutational biases, dinucleotide conservation rates, and the conservation rates of individual UTRs. The improved background model enabled preferential conservation of a new site type, the "offset 6mer," to be detected. In total, >45,000 miRNA target sites within human 3'UTRs are conserved above background levels, and >60\% of human protein-coding genes have been under selective pressure to maintain pairing to miRNAs. Mammalian-specific miRNAs have far fewer conserved targets than do the more broadly conserved miRNAs, even when considering only more recently emerged targets. Although pairing to the 3' end of miRNAs can compensate for seed mismatches, this class of sites constitutes less than 2\% of all preferentially conserved sites detected. The new tool enables statistically powerful analysis of individual miRNA target sites, with the probability of preferentially conserved targeting (P(CT)) correlating with experimental measurements of repression. Our expanded set of target predictions (including conserved 3'-compensatory sites), are available at the TargetScan website, which displays the P(CT) for each site and each predicted target.},

Mutations in the CP190 gene affect Fab-8 insulator activity, suggesting that CP190 is an essential component of both gypsy and dCTCF insulators. dCTCF is present at specific nuclear locations, forming large insulator bodies that overlap with those formed by Su(Hw), Mod(mdg4)2.2, and CP190. The results suggest that Su(Hw) and dCTCF may be the DNA-binding components of two different subsets of insulators that share CP190 and cooperate in the formation of insulator bodies to regulate the organization of the chromatin fiber in the nucleus.},

abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is largely enacted by transcription factors (TFs) binding DNA. Large numbers of TF binding motifs have been revealed by ChIP-chip experiments followed by computational DNA motif discovery. However, the success of motif discovery algorithms has been limited when applied to sequences bound in vivo (such as those identified by ChIP-chip) because the observed TF-DNA interactions are not necessarily direct: Some TFs predominantly associate with DNA indirectly through protein partners, while others exhibit both direct and indirect binding. Here, we present the first method for distinguishing between direct and indirect TF-DNA interactions, integrating in vivo TF binding data, in vivo nucleosome occupancy data, and motifs from in vitro protein binding microarray experiments. When applied to yeast ChIP-chip data, our method reveals that only 48\% of the data sets can be readily explained by direct binding of the profiled TF, while 16\% can be explained by indirect DNA binding. In the remaining 36\%, none of the motifs used in our analysis was able to explain the ChIP-chip data, either because the data were too noisy or because the set of motifs was incomplete. As more in vitro TF DNA binding motifs become available, our method could be used to build a complete catalog of direct and indirect TF-DNA interactions. Our method is not restricted to yeast or to ChIP-chip data, but can be applied in any system for which both in vivo binding data and in vitro DNA binding motifs are available.},

abstract = {To understand most cellular processes, one must understand how genetic information is processed. A formidable challenge is the dissection of gene regulatory networks to delineate how eukaryotic cells coordinate and govern patterns of gene expression that ultimately lead to a phenotype. In this paper, we review several approaches for modeling eukaryotic gene regulatory networks and for reverse engineering such networks from experimental observations. Since we are interested in elucidating the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of colon cancer progression, we use this important biological problem to illustrate various aspects of modeling gene regulation. We discuss four important models: gene networks, transcriptional regulatory systems, Boolean networks, and dynamical Bayesian networks. We review state-of-the-art functional genomics techniques, such as gene expression profiling, cis-regulatory element identification, TF target gene identification, and gene silencing by RNA interference, which can be used to extract information about gene regulation. We can employ this information, in conjunction with appropriately designed reverse engineering algorithms, to construct a computational model of gene regulation that sufficiently predicts experimental observations. In the last part of this review, we focus on the problem of reverse engineering transcriptional regulatory networks by gene perturbations. We mathematically formulate this problem and discuss the role of experimental resolution in our ability to reconstruct accurate models of gene regulation. We conclude, by discussing a promising approach for inferring a transcriptional regulatory system from microarray data obtained by gene perturbations.},

abstract = {The insulin/TOR pathway is a conserved regulator of cell and organism growth in metazoans. Over the last several years, an array of signaling inputs to this pathway has been defined. However the growth-regulatory outputs are less clear. Drosophila has proven to be a powerful genetic model system in which to study insulin/TOR signaling. This review highlights recent studies in Drosophila that have identified essential outputs and key effectors of the pathway. These include the regulation of ribosome synthesis, mRNA translation, autophagy and endocytosis, through downstream effectors such as Myc, FOXO, HIF1-alpha, TIF-IA, 4EBP and Atg1. This network of outputs and effectors can regulate cell and organismal metabolism, and is essential for the control of tissue growth, responses to starvation and stress, and aging. The mechanisms identified in Drosophila likely operate in most metazoans, and are relevent to our understanding of diseases caused by aberrent insulin/TOR signaling such as cancer, diabetes and obesity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fluorescent proteins such as GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) and DsRED (Discosoma sp.Red Fluorescent Protein) are often used as reporter molecules for transgene expression in Drosophila and other species. We have recently reported methods that allow simultaneous tracking of animal movement and GFP expression in real time, however the assay was limited to single animals and a single transgene. Numerous studies would be facilitated by methods that allow for assay of multiple animals and multiple transgenes. FINDINGS: Here we report an improved fly video tracking system that allows multiple transgenic flies to be tracked simultaneously using visible light, GFP fluorescence and DsRED fluorescence. The movement of multiple flies could be accurately tracked at real time rates, while simultaneously assaying the expression level of two different transgenes marked with GFP and DsRED. The individual flies could be accurately tracked and distinguished even during periods when transgene fluorescence was undetected. For example, characteristic patterns of hsp70 and hsp22 transgene induction could be simultaneously quantified and correlated with animal movement in aging flies, and as groups of flies died due to dessication/starvation. CONCLUSION: The improved methods allow for more efficient assay of the correlation between gene expression, behavior, aging and mortality: multiple animals can be assayed with simultaneous quantification of multiple transgenes using GFP and DsRED fluorescence. These methods should allow for increased flexibility in experimental designs. For example, in the future it should be possible to use gene expression levels to predict remaining life span more accurately, and to quantify gene expression changes caused by interactions between animals in real time.},

Fine-tuning of gene expression is often needed to maximize product yield and quality. However, for efficient knowledge-based engineering, a better understanding of promoter function is indispensable. Consequently, we created a promoter library by deletion and duplication of putative transcription factor-binding sites within the AOX1 promoter (P(AOX1)) sequence. This first library initially spanned an activity range between approximately 6\% and >160\% of the wild-type promoter activity. After characterization of the promoter library employing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) variant, the new regulatory toolbox was successfully utilized in a 'real case', i.e. the expression of industrial enzymes. Characterization of the library under repressing, derepressing and inducing conditions displayed at least 12 cis-acting elements involved in P(AOX1)-driven high-level expression. Based on this deletion analysis, novel short artificial promoter variants were constructed by combining cis-acting elements with basal promoter. In addition to improving yields and quality of heterologous protein production, the new P(AOX1) synthetic promoter library constitutes a basic toolbox to fine-tune gene expression in metabolic engineering and sequential induction of protein expression in synthetic biology.},

Here we report on the first use of this technology to gain insight into the wide range of transcriptional responses that are associated with an infectious disease process. Using Solexa/Illumina's digital gene expression (DGE) system, a tag-based transcriptome sequencing method, we investigated mycobacterium-induced transcriptome changes in a model vertebrate species, the zebrafish. We obtained a sequencing depth of over 5 million tags per sample with strong correlation between replicates. Tag mapping indicated that healthy and infected adult zebrafish express over 70\% of all genes represented in transcript databases. Comparison of the data with a previous multi-platform microarray analysis showed that both types of technologies identified regulation of similar functional groups of genes. However, the unbiased nature of DGE analysis provided insights that microarray analysis could not have achieved. In particular, we show that DGE data sets are instrumental for verification of predicted gene models and allowed us to detect mycobacterium-regulated switching between different transcript isoforms. Moreover, genomic mapping of infection-induced DGE tags revealed novel transcript forms for which any previous EST-based evidence of expression was lacking. In conclusion, our deep sequencing analysis revealed in depth the high degree of transcriptional complexity of the host response to mycobacterial infection and resulted in the discovery and validation of new gene products with induced expression in infected individuals.},

The main mediator of cellular nutrient sensing is the protein kinase TOR (target of rapamycin). TOR receives information from levels of cellular amino acids and energy, and it regulates the activity of processes involved in cell growth, such as protein synthesis and autophagy. Insulin-like signaling is the main mechanism of systemic nutrient sensing and mediates its growth-regulatory functions largely through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT protein kinase pathway. Other nutrition-regulated hormonal mechanisms contribute to growth control by modulating the activity of insulin-like signaling. The pathways mediating signals from systemic and cellular levels converge, allowing cells to combine information from both sources. Here we give an overview of the mechanisms that adjust animal tissue growth in response to nutrition and highlight some general features of the signaling pathways involved.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: The development of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) makes it possible for us to measure transcription at an unprecedented precision and throughput. However, challenges remain in understanding the source and distribution of the reads, modeling the transcript abundance and developing efficient computational methods. In this article, we develop a method to deal with the isoform expression estimation problem. The count of reads falling into a locus on the genome annotated with multiple isoforms is modeled as a Poisson variable. The expression of each individual isoform is estimated by solving a convex optimization problem and statistical inferences about the parameters are obtained from the posterior distribution by importance sampling. Our results show that isoform expression inference in RNA-Seq is possible by employing appropriate statistical methods.},

abstract = {Transcription from the core promoter of the juvenile hormone esterase gene (-61 to +28) requires the presence of both an AT-rich motif (TATA box) and an initiator motif for any transcription to occur, when assayed by either transcription in vitro with lepidopteran Sf9 nuclear extracts or by transient-transfection assay in Sf9 cells. Additional gel-shift experiments indicated that at least one additional binding site is essential for transcription to occur. Mutational analysis in the transcription-in vitro and cell-transfection assays demonstrated that a 14-bp region from +13 to +27 relative to the transcription start site is also essential for transcription to occur. Whereas the wild-type core promoter is highly transcriptionally active, inclusion of additional flanking sequences to position -212 reduces that activity approx. 100-fold, and inclusion of the 5' region out to position -500 reduces transcription by 200-fold. The pattern of dependence on both the AT-rich motif and the initiator for detectable transcription, and the high innate activity being repressed by 5'-binding factors, was recapitulated in mosquito C7-10 cells. This study demonstrates that the cellular juvenile hormone esterase gene is organized as a composite core promoter, dependent on both TATA-box and initiator-binding factors, an organization that has been more commonly reported for viral promoters. This highly active composite core promoter is made more complex by the absolute dependence on the presence of a third site shortly downstream from the initiator, which is distinct from the 'downstream promoter element' described from some TATA-less genes. The juvenile hormone esterase gene thus appears to be a model of a cellular composite core promoter with a multipartite, indispensible requirement for not just both the TATA box and initiator, but also for at least a third core element as well.},

abstract = {ChIP-Seq, which combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with ultra high-throughput massively parallel sequencing, is increasingly being used for mapping protein-DNA interactions in-vivo on a genome scale. Typically, short sequence reads from ChIP-Seq are mapped to a reference genome for further analysis. Although genomic regions enriched with mapped reads could be inferred as approximate binding regions, short read lengths (approximately 25-50 nt) pose challenges for determining the exact binding sites within these regions. Here, we present SISSRs (Site Identification from Short Sequence Reads), a novel algorithm for precise identification of binding sites from short reads generated from ChIP-Seq experiments. The sensitivity and specificity of SISSRs are demonstrated by applying it on ChIP-Seq data for three widely studied and well-characterized human transcription factors: CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor), NRSF (neuron-restrictive silencer factor) and STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 1). We identified 26 814, 5813 and 73 956 binding sites for CTCF, NRSF and STAT1 proteins, respectively, which is 32, 299 and 78\% more than that inferred previously for the respective proteins. Motif analysis revealed that an overwhelming majority of the identified binding sites contained the previously established consensus binding sequence for the respective proteins, thus attesting for SISSRs' accuracy. SISSRs' sensitivity and precision facilitated further analyses of ChIP-Seq data revealing interesting insights, which we believe will serve as guidance for designing ChIP-Seq experiments to map in vivo protein-DNA interactions. We also show that tag densities at the binding sites are a good indicator of protein-DNA binding affinity, which could be used to distinguish and characterize strong and weak binding sites. Using tag density as an indicator of DNA-binding affinity, we have identified core residues within the NRSF and CTCF binding sites that are critical for a stronger DNA binding.},

abstract = {The RNA polymerase II core promoter is generally defined to be the sequence that directs the initiation of transcription. This simple definition belies a diverse and complex transcriptional module. There are two major types of core promoters - focused and dispersed. Focused promoters contain either a single transcription start site or a distinct cluster of start sites over several nucleotides, whereas dispersed promoters contain several start sites over 50-100 nucleotides and are typically found in CpG islands in vertebrates. Focused promoters are more ancient and widespread throughout nature than dispersed promoters; however, in vertebrates, dispersed promoters are more common than focused promoters. In addition, core promoters may contain many different sequence motifs, such as the TATA box, BRE, Inr, MTE, DPE, DCE, and XCPE1, that specify different mechanisms of transcription and responses to enhancers. Thus, the core promoter is a sophisticated gateway to transcription that determines which signals will lead to transcription initiation.},

abstract = {The human genome is predominantly composed of nonprotein-coding sequences whose function remains largely undefined. A significant portion of the noncoding DNA is believed to serve as transcriptional regulatory elements that control gene expression in specific cell types at appropriate developmental stages. Identifying these regulatory sequences and determining the mechanisms by which they act present a great challenge in the postgenomic era. Previous investigations using genetic, molecular, and biochemical approaches have uncovered a large number of proteins involved in regulating transcription. Knowledge of the genomic locations of DNA binding for these proteins in the nucleus should define the identity and nature of the transcriptional regulatory sequences and reveal the gene regulatory networks in cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a common method for detecting interactions between a protein and a DNA sequence in vivo. In recent years, this method has been combined with DNA microarrays and other high-throughput technologies to enable genome-wide identification of DNA-binding sites for various nuclear proteins. Here, we review recent advances in ChIP-based methods for genome-wide detection of protein-DNA interactions, and discuss their significance in enhancing our knowledge of the gene regulatory networks and epigenetic mechanisms in cells.},

abstract = {Revealing the spectrum of combinatorial regulation of transcription at individual promoters is essential for understanding the complex structure of biological networks. However, the computations represented by the integration of various molecular signals at complex promoters are difficult to decipher in the absence of simple cis regulatory codes. Here we synthetically shuffle the regulatory architecture--operator sequences binding activators and repressors--of a canonical bacterial promoter. The resulting library of complex promoters allows for rapid exploration of promoter encoded logic regulation. Among all possible logic functions, NOR and ANDN promoter encoded logics predominate. A simple transcriptional cis regulatory code determines both logics, establishing a straightforward map between promoter structure and logic phenotype. The regulatory code is determined solely by the type of transcriptional regulation combinations: two repressors generate a NOR: NOT (a OR b) whereas a repressor and an activator generate an ANDN: a AND NOT b. Three-input versions of both logics, having an additional repressor as an input, are also present in the library. The resulting complex promoters cover a wide dynamic range of transcriptional strengths. Synthetic promoter shuffling represents a fast and efficient method for exploring the spectrum of complex regulatory functions that can be encoded by complex promoters. From an engineering point of view, synthetic promoter shuffling enables the experimental testing of the functional properties of complex promoters that cannot necessarily be inferred ab initio from the known properties of the individual genetic components. Synthetic promoter shuffling may provide a useful experimental tool for studying naturally occurring promoter shuffling.},

abstract = {Members of the GATA family of transcription factors, which are related by a high degree of amino acid sequence identity within their zinc finger DNA-binding domains, each show distinct but overlapping patterns of tissue-restricted expression. Although GATA-1, -2, and -3 have been shown to recognize a consensus sequence derived from regulatory elements in erythroid cell-specific genes, WGATAR (in which W indicates A/T and R indicates A/G), the potential for more subtle differences in the binding preferences of each factor has not been previously addressed. By employing a binding selection and polymerase chain reaction amplification scheme with randomized oligonucleotides, we have determined the binding-site specificities of bacterially expressed chicken GATA-1, -2, and -3 transcription factors. Whereas all three GATA factors bind an AGATAA erythroid consensus motif with high affinity, a second, alternative consensus DNA sequence, AGATCTTA, is also recognized well by GATA-2 and GATA-3 but only poorly by GATA-1. These studies suggest that all three GATA factors are capable of mediating transcriptional effects via a common erythroid consensus DNA-binding motif. Furthermore, GATA-2 and GATA-3, because of their distinct expression patterns and broader DNA recognition properties, may be involved in additional regulatory processes beyond those of GATA-1. The definition of an alternative GATA-2-GATA-3 consensus sequence may facilitate the identification of new target genes in the further elucidation of the roles that these transcription factors play during development.},

Here we use gene conversion to mutate specific DNA motifs within a PRE to test their relevance, and we exchange PREs to test their specificity. Previously we showed that removal of a 185 bp core sequence from the bithoraxoid PRE of the bithorax complex results in posteriorly directed segmental transformations. Mutating multiple binding sites for either the PHO or the GAF proteins separately in the core bithoraxoid PRE resulted in only rare and subtle transformations in adult flies. However, when both sets of sites were mutated, the transformations were similar in strength and penetrance to those caused by the deletion of the 185 bp core region. In contrast, mutating the singly occurring binding site of another DNA-binding protein, DSP1 (reportedly essential for PRE-activity), had no similar effect in combination with mutated PHO or GAF sites. Two minimal PREs from other segment-specific regulatory domains of the bithorax complex could substitute for the bithoraxoid PRE core. Our in situ analysis suggests that core PREs are interchangeable, and the cooperation between PHO and GAF binding sites is indispensable for silencing.},

The development of a synthetic Medea element that has been shown to drive population replacement in laboratory Drosophila populations has provided encouragement for this strategy but has also been greeted with caution over the concern that transgenes may spread into countries without their consent. Here, we propose a novel gene drive system, inverse Medea, which is strong enough to bring about local population replacement but is unable to establish itself beyond an isolated release site. The system consists of 2 genetic components--a zygotic toxin and maternal antidote--which render heterozygous offspring of wild-type mothers unviable. Through population genetic analysis, we show that inverse Medea will only spread when it represents a majority of the alleles in a population. The element is best located on an autosome and will spread to fixation provided any associated fitness costs are dominant and to very high frequency otherwise. We suggest molecular tools that could be used to build the inverse Medea system and discuss its utility for a confined release of transgenic mosquitoes.},

Semele consists of two components: a toxin expressed in transgenic males that either kills or renders infertile wild-type female recipients and an antidote expressed in females that protects them from the effects of the toxin. An all-male release results in population suppression because wild-type females that mate with transgenic males produce no offspring. A release that includes transgenic females results in gene drive since females carrying the allele are favored at high population frequencies. We use simple population genetic models to explore the utility of the Semele system. We find that Semele can spread under a wide range of conditions, all of which require a high introduction frequency. This feature is desirable since transgenic insects released accidentally are unlikely to persist, transgenic insects released intentionally can be spatially confined, and the element can be removed from a population through sustained release of wild-type insects. We examine potential barriers to Semele gene drive and suggest molecular tools that could be used to build the Semele system.},

However there is little or no information available for guiding the end users choice of method. Furthermore it would be necessary to obtain several different software programs from various sources to make a well-founded choice. METHODOLOGY: We introduce a software package, Asap, for fast searching with position weight matrices that include several standard methods for assessing over-representation. We have compared the ability of these methods to detect over-represented transcription factor binding sites in artificial promoter sequences. Controlling all aspects of our input data we are able to identify the optimal statistics across multiple threshold values and for sequence sets containing different distributions of transcription factor binding sites. CONCLUSIONS: We show that our implementation is significantly faster than more na\"{\i}ve scanning algorithms when searching with many weight matrices in large sequence sets. When comparing the various statistics, we show that those based on binomial over-representation and Fisher's exact test performs almost equally good and better than the others.

abstract = {GATA-binding proteins constitute a family of transcription factors that recognize a target site conforming to the consensus WGATAR (W = A or T and R = A or G). Here we have used the method of polymerase chain reaction-mediated random site selection to assess in an unbiased manner the DNA-binding specificity of GATA proteins. Contrary to our expectations, we show that GATA proteins bind a variety of motifs that deviate from the previously assigned consensus. Many of the nonconsensus sequences bind protein with high affinity, equivalent to that of conventional GATA motifs. By using the selected sequences as probes in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we demonstrate overlapping, but distinct, sequence preferences for GATA family members, specified by their respective DNA-binding domains. Furthermore, we provide additional evidence for interaction of amino and carboxy fingers of GATA-1 in defining its binding site. By performing cotransfection experiments, we also show that transactivation parallels DNA binding. A chimeric protein containing the finger domain of areA and the activation domains of GATA-1 is capable of activating transcription in mammalian cells through GATA motifs. Our findings suggest a mechanism by which GATA proteins might selectively regulate gene expression in cells in which they are coexpressed.},

abstract = {Abstract Next generation high-throughput sequencing (NGS) is poised to replace array-based technologies as the experiment of choice for measuring RNA expression levels. Several groups have demonstrated the power of this new approach (RNA-seq), making significant and novel contributions and simultaneously proposing methodologies for the analysis of RNA-seq data. In a typical experiment, millions of short sequences (reads) are sampled from RNA extracts and mapped back to a reference genome. The number of reads mapping to each gene is used as proxy for its corresponding RNA concentration. A significant challenge in analyzing RNA expression of homologous genes is the large fraction of the reads that map to multiple locations in the reference genome. Currently, these reads are either dropped from the analysis, or a naive algorithm is used to estimate their underlying distribution. In this work, we present a rigorous alternative for handling the reads generated in an RNA-seq experiment within a probabilistic model for RNA-seq data; we develop maximum likelihood-based methods for estimating the model parameters. In contrast to previous methods, our model takes into account the fact that the DNA of the sequenced individual is not a perfect copy of the reference sequence. We show with both simulated and real RNA-seq data that our new method improves the accuracy and power of RNA-seq experiments.},

abstract = {A simple and efficient DNA delivery method to introduce extrachromosomal DNA into mosquito embryos would significantly aid functional genomic studies. The conventional method for delivery of DNA into insects is to inject the DNA directly into the embryos. Taking advantage of the unique aspects of mosquito reproductive physiology during vitellogenesis and an in vivo transfection reagent that mediates DNA uptake in cells via endocytosis, we have developed a new method to introduce DNA into mosquito embryos vertically via microinjection of DNA vectors in vitellogenic females without directly manipulating the embryos. Our method was able to introduce inducible gene expression vectors transiently into F0 mosquitoes to perform functional studies in vivo without transgenic lines. The high efficiency of expression knockdown was reproducible with more than 70\% of the F0 individuals showed sufficient gene expression suppression (<30\% of the controls' levels). At the cohort level, AeSCP-2 expression knockdown in early instar larvae resulted in detectable phenotypes of the expression deficiency such as high mortality, lowered fertility, and distorted sex ratio after induction of AeSCP-2 siRNA expression in vivo. The results further confirmed the important role of AeSCP-2 in the development and reproduction of A. aegypti. In this study, we proved that extrachromosaomal transient expression of an inducible gene from a DNA vector vertically delivered via vitellogenic females can be used to manipulate gene expression in F0 generation. This new method will be a simple and efficient tool for in vivo functional genomic studies in mosquitoes.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Chemosensory signal transduction guides the behavior of many insects, including Anopheles gambiae, the major vector for human malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. To better understand the molecular basis of mosquito chemosensation we used whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to compare transcript expression profiles between the two major chemosensory tissues, the antennae and maxillary palps, of adult female and male An. gambiae. RESULTS: We compared chemosensory tissue transcriptomes to whole body transcriptomes of each sex to identify chemosensory enhanced or specific genes. In the six data sets analyzed, we detected expression of nearly all known chemosensory genes and found them to be highly enriched in both olfactory tissues of the male and female. While the maxillary palps of both sexes demonstrated strict chemosensory gene expression overlap, we observed acute differences in sensory specialization between the male and female antennae. The relatively high expression levels of chemosensory genes in the female antennae reveal its role as an organ predominately assigned to chemosensation. Remarkably, the expression of these genes was highly conserved in the male antennae, but at much lower relative levels. Alternatively, consistent with a role in mating, the male antennae displayed significant enhancement of genes involved in audition, while the female enhancement of these genes was observed, but to a lesser degree. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the chemoreceptive spectrum, as defined by gene expression profiles, is largely similar in female and male An. gambiae. However, assuming sensory receptor expression levels are correlated with sensitivity in each case, we posit that male and female antennae are perceptive to the same stimuli, but possess inverse receptive prioritizations and sensitivities. Here we have demonstrated the use of RNA-seq to characterize the sensory specializations of an important disease vector and grounded future studies investigating chemosensory processes.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing, polyadenylation of pre-messenger RNA molecules and differential promoter usage can produce a variety of transcript isoforms whose respective expression levels are regulated in time and space, thus contributing specific biological functions. However, the repertoire of mammalian alternative transcripts and their regulation are still poorly understood. Second-generation sequencing is now opening unprecedented routes to address the analysis of entire transcriptomes. Here, we developed methods that allow the prediction and quantification of alternative isoforms derived solely from exon expression levels in RNA-Seq data. These are based on an explicit statistical model and enable the prediction of alternative isoforms within or between conditions using any known gene annotation, as well as the relative quantification of known transcript structures. Applying these methods to a human RNA-Seq dataset, we validated a significant fraction of the predictions by RT-PCR. Data further showed that these predictions correlated well with information originating from junction reads. A direct comparison with exon arrays indicated improved performances of RNA-Seq over microarrays in the prediction of skipped exons. Altogether, the set of methods presented here comprehensively addresses multiple aspects of alternative isoform analysis.

@article{Rivero2010,
abstract = {Many of the most dangerous human diseases are transmitted by insect vectors. After decades of repeated insecticide use, all of these vector species have demonstrated the capacity to evolve resistance to insecticides. Insecticide resistance is generally considered to undermine control of vector-transmitted diseases because it increases the number of vectors that survive the insecticide treatment. Disease control failure, however, need not follow from vector control failure. Here, we review evidence that insecticide resistance may have an impact on the quality of vectors and, specifically, on three key determinants of parasite transmission: vector longevity, competence, and behaviour. We argue that, in some instances, insecticide resistance is likely to result in a decrease in vector longevity, a decrease in infectiousness, or in a change in behaviour, all of which will reduce the vectorial capacity of the insect. If this effect is sufficiently large, the impact of insecticide resistance on disease management may not be as detrimental as previously thought. In other instances, however, insecticide resistance may have the opposite effect, increasing the insect's vectorial capacity, which may lead to a dramatic increase in the transmission of the disease and even to a higher prevalence than in the absence of insecticides. Either way-and there may be no simple generality-the consequence of the evolution of insecticide resistance for disease ecology deserves additional attention.},

Using two deeply sequenced data sets for human RNA polymerase II and STAT1, each with matching input-DNA controls, we describe a general scoring approach to address unique challenges in ChIP-seq data analysis. Our approach is based on the observation that sites of potential binding are strongly correlated with signal peaks in the control, likely revealing features of open chromatin. We develop a two-pass strategy called PeakSeq to compensate for this. A two-pass strategy compensates for signal caused by open chromatin, as revealed by inclusion of the controls. The first pass identifies putative binding sites and compensates for genomic variation in the 'mappability' of sequences. The second pass filters out sites not significantly enriched compared to the normalized control, computing precise enrichments and significances. Our scoring procedure enables us to optimize experimental design by estimating the depth of sequencing required for a desired level of coverage and demonstrating that more than two replicates provides only a marginal gain in information.},

abstract = {Malaria transmission depends on infective stages in the mosquito salivary glands. Plasmodium sporozoites that mature in midgut oocysts must traverse the hemocoel and invade the mosquito salivary glands in a process thought to be mediated by parasite ligands. MAEBL, a homologue of the transmembrane EBP ligands essential in merozoite invasion, is expressed abundantly in midgut sporozoites. Alternative splicing generates different MAEBL isoforms and so it is unclear what form is functionally essential. To identify the MAEBL isoform required for P. falciparum (NF54) sporozoite invasion of salivary glands, we created knockout and allelic replacements each carrying CDS of a single MAEBL isoform. Only the transmembrane form of MAEBL is essential and is the first P. falciparum ligand validated as essential for invasion of Anopheles salivary glands. MAEBL is the first P. falciparum ligand experimentally determined to be essential for this important step in the life cycle where the vector becomes infectious for transmitting sporozoites to people. With an increasing emphasis on advancing vector-based transgenic methods for suppression of malaria, it is important that this type of study, using modern molecular genetic tools, is done with the agent of the human disease. Understanding what P. falciparum sporozoite ligands are critical for mosquito transmission will help validate targets for vector-based transmission-blocking strategies.},

Population replacement requires a drive mechanism to ensure the rapid spread of linked transgenes, the presence of which may result in a fitness cost to carriers. Medea selfish genetic elements have the feature that when present in a female, only offspring that inherit the element survive, a behavior that can lead to spread. Here, we derive equations that describe the conditions under which Medea elements with a fitness cost will spread, and the equilibrium allele frequencies are achieved. Of particular importance, we show that whenever Medea spreads, the non-Medea genotype is driven out of the population, and we estimate the number of generations required to achieve this goal for Medea elements with different fitness costs and male-only introduction frequencies. Finally, we characterize two contexts in which Medea elements with fitness costs drive the non-Medea allele from the population: an autosomal element in which not all Medea-bearing progeny of a Medea-bearing mother survive, and an X-linked element in species in which X/Y individuals are male. Our results suggest that Medea elements can drive population replacement under a wide range of conditions.},

abstract = {Changes in transcript levels are assessed by microarray analysis on an individual basis, essentially resulting in long lists of genes that were found to have significantly changed transcript levels. However, in biology these changes do not occur as independent events as such lists suggest, but in a highly coordinated and interdependent manner. Understanding the biological meaning of the observed changes requires elucidating such biological interdependencies. The most common way to achieve this is to project the gene lists onto distinct biological processes often represented in the form of gene-ontology (GO) categories or metabolic and regulatory pathways as derived from literature analysis. This review focuses on different approaches and tools employed for this task, starting form GO-ranking methods, covering pathway mappings, finally converging on biological network analysis. A brief outlook of the application of such approaches to the newest microarray-based technologies (Chromatin-ImmunoPrecipitation, ChIP-on-chip) concludes the review.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rate of mRNA transcription is controlled by transcription factors that bind to specific DNA motifs in promoter regions upstream of protein coding genes. Recent results indicate that not only the presence of a motif but also motif context (for example the orientation of a motif or its location relative to the coding sequence) is important for gene regulation. RESULTS: In this study we present ContextFinder, a tool that is specifically aimed at identifying cases where motif context is likely to affect gene regulation. We used ContextFinder to examine the role of motif context in S. cerevisiae both for DNA binding by transcription factors and for effects on gene expression. For DNA binding we found significant patterns of motif location bias, whereas motif orientations did not seem to matter. Motif context appears to affect gene expression even more than it affects DNA binding, as biases in both motif location and orientation were more frequent in promoters of co-expressed genes. We validated our results against data on nucleosome positioning, and found a negative correlation between preferred motif locations and nucleosome occupancy. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the requirement for stable binding of transcription factors to DNA and their subsequent function in gene regulation can impose constraints on motif context.},

@article{Wilhelm2008,
abstract = {Recent data from several organisms indicate that the transcribed portions of genomes are larger and more complex than expected, and that many functional properties of transcripts are based not on coding sequences but on regulatory sequences in untranslated regions or non-coding RNAs. Alternative start and polyadenylation sites and regulation of intron splicing add additional dimensions to the rich transcriptional output. This transcriptional complexity has been sampled mainly using hybridization-based methods under one or few experimental conditions. Here we applied direct high-throughput sequencing of complementary DNAs (RNA-Seq), supplemented with data from high-density tiling arrays, to globally sample transcripts of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, independently from available gene annotations. We interrogated transcriptomes under multiple conditions, including rapid proliferation, meiotic differentiation and environmental stress, as well as in RNA processing mutants to reveal the dynamic plasticity of the transcriptional landscape as a function of environmental, developmental and genetic factors. High-throughput sequencing proved to be a powerful and quantitative method to sample transcriptomes deeply at maximal resolution. In contrast to hybridization, sequencing showed little, if any, background noise and was sensitive enough to detect widespread transcription in >90\% of the genome, including traces of RNAs that were not robustly transcribed or rapidly degraded. The combined sequencing and strand-specific array data provide rich condition-specific information on novel, mostly non-coding transcripts, untranslated regions and gene structures, thus improving the existing genome annotation. Sequence reads spanning exon-exon or exon-intron junctions give unique insight into a surprising variability in splicing efficiency across introns, genes and conditions. Splicing efficiency was largely coordinated with transcript levels, and increased transcription led to increased splicing in test genes. Hundreds of introns showed such regulated splicing during cellular proliferation or differentiation.},

This strain circumvents the need for radiation-induced sterilization, allows genetic sexing resulting in male-only releases, and permits the release of eggs instead of adult mosquitoes. OX3604C males introduced weekly into large laboratory cages containing stable target mosquito populations at initial ratios of 8.5-101 OX3604Ctarget eliminated the populations within 10-20 weeks. These data support the further testing of this strain in contained or confined field trials to evaluate mating competitiveness and environmental and other effects.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Understanding gene regulation in Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, is an important step in deciphering its complex life cycle as well as leading to possible new targets for therapeutic applications. Very little is known about gene regulation in Plasmodium, and in particular, few regulatory elements have been identified. Such discovery has been significantly hampered by the high A-T content of some of the genomes of Plasmodium species, as well as the challenge in associating discovered regulatory elements to gene regulatory cascades due to Plasmodium's complex life cycle. RESULTS: We report a new method of using comparative genomics to systematically discover motifs in Plasmodium without requiring any functional data. Different from previous methods, our method does not depend on sequence alignments, and thus is particularly suitable for highly divergent genomes. We applied our method to discovering regulatory motifs between the human parasite, P.falciparum, and its rodent-infectious relative, P.yoelii. We also tested our procedure against comparisons between P.falciparum and the primate-infectious, P.knowlesi. Our computational effort leads to an initial catalog of 38 distinct motifs, corresponding to over 16 200 sites in the Plasmodium genome. The functionality of these motifs was further supported by their defined distribution within the genome as well as a correlation with gene expression patterns. This initial map provides a systematic view of gene regulation in Plasmodium, which can be refined as additional genomes become available. AVAILABILITY: The new algorithm, named motif discovery using orthologous sequences (MDOS), is available at http://www.ics.uci.edu/ approximately xhx/project/mdos/.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the sequence of the Plasmodium falciparum genome and several global mRNA and protein life cycle expression profiling projects now completed, elucidating the underlying networks of transcriptional control important for the progression of the parasite life cycle is highly pertinent to the development of new anti-malarials. To date, relatively little is known regarding the specific mechanisms the parasite employs to regulate gene expression at the mRNA level, with studies of the P. falciparum genome sequence having revealed few cis-regulatory elements and associated transcription factors. Although it is possible the parasite may evoke mechanisms of transcriptional control drastically different from those used by other eukaryotic organisms, the extreme AT-rich nature of P. falciparum intergenic regions (approximately 90\% AT) presents significant challenges to in silico cis-regulatory element discovery. RESULTS: We have developed an algorithm called Gene Enrichment Motif Searching (GEMS) that uses a hypergeometric-based scoring function and a position-weight matrix optimization routine to identify with high-confidence regulatory elements in the nucleotide-biased and repeat sequence-rich P. falciparum genome. When applied to promoter regions of genes contained within 21 co-expression gene clusters generated from P. falciparum life cycle microarray data using the semi-supervised clustering algorithm Ontology-based Pattern Identification, GEMS identified 34 putative cis-regulatory elements associated with a variety of parasite processes including sexual development, cell invasion, antigenic variation and protein biosynthesis. Among these candidates were novel motifs, as well as many of the elements for which biological experimental evidence already exists in the Plasmodium literature. To provide evidence for the biological relevance of a cell invasion-related element predicted by GEMS, reporter gene and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were conducted. CONCLUSION: This GEMS analysis demonstrates that in silico regulatory element discovery can be successfully applied to challenging repeat-sequence-rich, base-biased genomes such as that of P. falciparum. The fact that regulatory elements were predicted from a diverse range of functional gene clusters supports the hypothesis that cis-regulatory elements play a role in the transcriptional control of many P. falciparum biological processes. The putative regulatory elements described represent promising candidates for future biological investigation into the underlying transcriptional control mechanisms of gene regulation in malaria parasites.},

abstract = {ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a new method for genomewide mapping of protein binding sites on DNA. It has generated much excitement in functional genomics. To score data and determine adequate sequencing depth, both the genomic background and the binding sites must be properly modeled. To develop a computational foundation to tackle these issues, we first performed a study to characterize the observed statistical nature of this new type of high-throughput data. By linking sequence tags into clusters, we show that there are two components to the distribution of tag counts observed in a number of recent experiments: an initial power-law distribution and a subsequent long right tail. Then we develop in silico ChIP-seq, a computational method to simulate the experimental outcome by placing tags onto the genome according to particular assumed distributions for the actual binding sites and for the background genomic sequence. In contrast to current assumptions, our results show that both the background and the binding sites need to have a markedly nonuniform distribution in order to correctly model the observed ChIP-seq data, with, for instance, the background tag counts modeled by a gamma distribution. On the basis of these results, we extend an existing scoring approach by using a more realistic genomic-background model. This enables us to identify transcription-factor binding sites in ChIP-seq data in a statistically rigorous fashion.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Signaling pathways are dynamic events that take place over a given period of time. In order to identify these pathways, expression data over time are required. Dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is an important approach for predicting the gene regulatory networks from time course expression data. However, two fundamental problems greatly reduce the effectiveness of current DBN methods. The first problem is the relatively low accuracy of prediction, and the second is the excessive computational time. RESULTS: In this paper, we present a DBN-based approach with increased accuracy and reduced computational time compared with existing DBN methods. Unlike previous methods, our approach limits potential regulators to those genes with either earlier or simultaneous expression changes (up- or down-regulation) in relation to their target genes. This allows us to limit the number of potential regulators and consequently reduce the search space. Furthermore, we use the time difference between the initial change in the expression of a given regulator gene and its potential target gene to estimate the transcriptional time lag between these two genes. This method of time lag estimation increases the accuracy of predicting gene regulatory networks. Our approach is evaluated using time-series expression data measured during the yeast cell cycle. The results demonstrate that this approach can predict regulatory networks with significantly improved accuracy and reduced computational time compared with existing DBN approaches.},

UNC93A and synaptic vesicle-2 (SV2) proteins are involved in intracellular transport in mammals. They show amino acid sequence conservation from mosquitoes to humans, and their transcripts are highly enriched in Aedes aegypti during arbovirus infection. Transient gene silencing of SV2 or UNC93A in mosquitoes infected with the recombinant alphavirus Sindbis MRE16-enhanced green fluorescent protein (SINV; family Togaviridae) resulted in the accumulation of viral positive- and negative-strand RNA, congregation of virus envelope antigen in intracellular networks, and reduced virus dissemination outside of the midgut. Further, UNC93A silencing, but not SV2 silencing, resulted in a 10-fold reduction in viral titres at 4 days post-infection. Together, these data support a role for UNC93A and SV2 in virus assembly or budding. Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) were identified at the 5'-ends of genes from the original data set in which SV2 and UNC93A were identified. Common CREs at the 5'-end genomic regions of a subset of enriched transcripts support the hypothesis that UNC93A transcription may be co-regulated with that of other ion transport and endosomal trafficking proteins.},

Similar to deletion of HSEII, insertion in the spacer between the HSEs of 1 to 5 or 11 to 14 nucleotides (nt) reduced promoter activity to about 10\%. In contrast, HSEII was capable of contributing to promoter activity when the spacer was either shortened by 2 or 4 nt or extended by 6 to 10 or 16 or 18 nt. Hence, half of the possible helical arrangements of HSEs are compatible, whereas the other half are essentially incompatible with efficient promoter function. HSEII was ineffective when its distance to HSEI was increased by more than 18 nt. In vitro, HSEII is a weak and HSEI a strong binding site for heat shock transcription factor HSF, and HSF binds to HSEII cooperatively. To find out whether the above periodicity reflects cooperative binding of HSF in vivo or represents the need of stereoalignment for synergistic activation of transcription, the weak HSF binding site HSEII was replaced with the strong binding site HSEI. This substitution greatly attenuated promoter periodicity, suggesting that the periodic effects are caused by cooperative binding of HSF to HSEII, and that stereoalignment of HSEs is not required for transcription activation. In agreement, in vitro assays using spacer mutants revealed cooperative binding of purified, recombinant HSF to HSEII with a similar periodicity as observed in vivo. Changing the distance between TATA and the HSEs did not produce promoter periodicity, indicating that stereoalignment of these elements is not important.},

We sought to increase this repertoire by characterizing the ability of upstream sequences derived from the Ae. aegypti Ub(L40) and polyubiquitin genes to drive the expression of marker proteins. Both genomic fragments were able to drive robust expression of luciferase in cultured mosquito cells. Following Mos1-transformation, the Ub(L40) promoter drove strong expression of a fluorescent marker in early larvae and in ovaries, while the polyubiquitin promoter drove robust EGFP expression in all stages of development, including constitutive expression throughout the midgut. These promoter fragments provide two new expression profiles for future Ae. aegypti genetic experiments.},

Multiple motifs are found by fitting a mixture model to the data, probabilistically erasing the occurrences of the motif thus found, and repeating the process to find successive motifs. The algorithm requires only a set of unaligned sequences and a number specifying the width of the motifs as input. It returns a model of each motif and a threshold which together can be used as a Bayes-optimal classifier for searching for occurrences of the motif in other databases. The algorithm estimates how many times each motif occurs in each sequence in the dataset and outputs an alignment of the occurrences of the motif. The algorithm is capable of discovering several different motifs with differing numbers of occurrences in a single dataset.},

@article{Bonizzoni2011a,
abstract = {Background: Hematophagy is a common trait of insect vectors of disease. Extensive genome-wide transcriptional changes occur in mosquitoes after blood meals, and these are related to digestive and reproductive processes, among others. Studies of these changes are expected to reveal molecular targets for novel vector control and pathogen transmission-blocking strategies. The mosquito Aedes aegypti (Diptera, Culicidae), a vector of Dengue viruses, Yellow Fever Virus (YFV) and Chikungunya virus (CV), is the subject of this study to look at genome-wide changes in gene expression following a blood meal. Results: Transcriptional changes that follow a blood meal in Ae. aegypti females were explored using RNA-seq technology. Over 30\% of more than 18,000 investigated transcripts accumulate differentially in mosquitoes at five hours after a blood meal when compared to those fed only on sugar. Forty transcripts accumulate only in blood-fed mosquitoes. The list of regulated transcripts correlates with an enhancement of digestive activity and a suppression of environmental stimuli perception and innate immunity. The alignment of more than 65 million high-quality short reads to the Ae. aegypti reference genome permitted the refinement of the current annotation of transcript boundaries, as well as the discovery of novel transcripts, exons and splicing variants. Cis-regulatory elements (CRE) and cis-regulatory modules (CRM) enriched significantly at the 5'end flanking sequences of blood meal-regulated genes were identified. Conclusions: This study provides the first global view of the changes in transcript accumulation elicited by a blood meal in Ae. aegypti females. This information permitted the identification of classes of potentially co-regulated genes and a description of biochemical and physiological events that occur immediately after blood feeding. The data presented here serve as a basis for novel vector control and pathogen transmission-blocking strategies including those in which the vectors are modified genetically to express anti-pathogen effector molecules.},

abstract = {Aedes aegypti utilizes blood for energy production, egg maturation and replenishment of maternal reserves. The principle midgut enzymes responsible for bloodmeal digestion are endoproteolytic serine-type proteases within the S1.A subfamily. While there are hundreds of serine protease-like genes in the A. aegypti genome, only five are known to be expressed in the midgut. We describe the cloning, sequencing and expression profiling of seven additional serine proteases and provide a genomic and phylogenetic assessment of these findings. Of the seven genes, four are constitutively expressed and three are transcriptionally induced upon blood feeding. The amount of transcriptional induction is strongly correlated among these genes. Alignments reveal that, in general, the conserved catalytic triad, active site and accessory catalytic residues are maintained in these genes and phylogenetic analysis shows that these genes fall within three distinct clades; trypsins, chymotrypsins and serine collagenases. Interestingly, a previously described trypsin consistently arose with other serine collagenases in phylogenetic analyses. These results suggest that multiple gene duplications have arisen within the S1.A subfamily of midgut serine proteases and/or that A. aegypti has evolved an array of proteases with a broad range of substrate specificities for rapid, efficient digestion of bloodmeals.},

abstract = {The ultrastructure of endocrine cells in the midgut of the adult mosquito, Aedes aegypti, resembled that of endocrine cells in the vertebrate gastro-intestinal tract. Midgut endocrine cells, positioned basally in the epithelium as single cells, were cone-shaped and smaller than the columnar digestive cells. The most distinctive characteristic of endocrine cells was numerous round secretory granules along the lateral and basal plasma membranes where contents of the granules were released by exocytosis. Secretory granules in each individual cell were exclusively of one type, either solid or 'haloed', and for all cells observed, the range in granule diameter was 60-120 nm. The cytoplasm varied in density from clear to dark. Lamellar bodies were prominent in the apical and lateral cellular regions and did not exhibit acid phosphatase activity. The basal plasma membrane was smooth adjacent to the basal lamina, whereas in digestive cells the membrane formed a labyrinth. Some endocrine cells reached the midgut lumen and were capped by microvilli; a system of vesicles and tubules extended from beneath the microvilli to the cell body. An estimated 500 endocrine cells were distributed in both the thoracic and abdominal regions of the adult midgut. In one midgut, we classified a sample of endocrine cells according to cytoplasmic density and granule type and size; endocrine cells with certain types of granules had specific distributions within the midgut.},

In Africa, which suffers most from malaria, mosquito vector populations are spread almost throughout the entire continent, and the parasite reservoir is big and continuously increasing. Moreover, malaria is transmitted by many species of anophelines with specific seasonal and geographical patterns. Therefore, a well designed, evolutionarily robust and publicly accepted plan aiming at population reduction or replacement is required. The task is twofold: to engineer mosquitoes with a genetic trait that confers resistance to malaria or causes population suppression; and, to drive the new trait through field populations. This review examines these two issues, and describes the groundwork that has been done towards understanding of the complex relation between the parasite and its vector.},

abstract = {Background: High-throughput sequencing of an organism's transcriptome, or RNA-Seq, is a valuable and versatile new strategy for capturing snapshots of gene expression. However, transcriptome sequencing creates a new class of alignment problem: mapping short reads that span exon-exon junctions back to the reference genome, especially in the case where a splice junction is previously unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we introduce HMMSplicer, an accurate and efficient algorithm for discovering canonical and non-canonical splice junctions in short read datasets. HMMSplicer identifies more splice junctions than currently available algorithms when tested on publicly available A. thaliana, P. falciparum, and H. sapiens datasets without a reduction in specificity. Conclusions/Significance: HMMSplicer was found to perform especially well in compact genomes and on genes with low expression levels, alternative splice isoforms, or non-canonical splice junctions. Because HHMSplicer does not rely on pre-built gene models, the products of inexact splicing are also detected. For H. sapiens, we find 3.6\% of 3 splice sites and 1.4\% of 5 splice sites are inexact, typically differing by 3 bases in either direction. In addition, HMMSplicer provides a score for every predicted junction allowing the user to set a threshold to tune false positive rates depending on the needs of the experiment. HMMSplicer is implemented in Python. Code and documentation are freely available at http://derisilab.ucsf.edu/software/hmmsplicer.},

abstract = {Chemical interactions between plants and their insect herbivores provide an excellent opportunity to study the evolution of species interactions on a molecular level. Here, we investigate the molecular evolutionary events that gave rise to a novel detoxifying enzyme (nitrile-specifier protein [NSP]) in the butterfly family Pieridae, previously identified as a coevolutionary key innovation. By generating and sequencing expressed sequence tags, genomic libraries, and screening databases we found NSP to be a member of an insect-specific gene family, which we characterized and named the NSP-like gene family. Members consist of variable tandem repeats, are gut expressed, and are found across Insecta evolving in a dynamic, ongoing birth-death process. In the Lepidoptera, multiple copies of single-domain major allergen genes are present and originate via tandem duplications. Multiple domain genes are found solely within the brassicaceous-feeding Pieridae butterflies, one of them being NSP and another called major allergen (MA). Analyses suggest that NSP and its paralog MA have a unique single-domain evolutionary origin, being formed by intragenic domain duplication followed by tandem whole-gene duplication. Duplicates subsequently experienced a period of relaxed constraint followed by an increase in constraint, perhaps after neofunctionalization. NSP and its ortholog MA are still experiencing high rates of change, reflecting a dynamic evolution consistent with the known role of NSP in plant-insect interactions. Our results provide direct evidence to the hypothesis that gene duplication is one of the driving forces for speciation and adaptation, showing that both within- and whole-gene tandem duplications are a powerful force underlying evolutionary adaptation.},

abstract = {Transcription factor binding site(s) (TFBS) gain and loss (i.e., turnover) is a well-documented feature of cis-regulatory module (CRM) evolution, yet little attention has been paid to the evolutionary force(s) driving this turnover process. The predominant view, motivated by its widespread occurrence, emphasizes the importance of compensatory mutation and genetic drift. Positive selection, in contrast, although it has been invoked in specific instances of adaptive gene expression evolution, has not been considered as a general alternative to neutral compensatory evolution. In this study we evaluate the two hypotheses by analyzing patterns of single nucleotide polymorphism in the TFBS of well-characterized CRM in two closely related Drosophila species, Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans. An important feature of the analysis is classification of TFBS mutations according to the direction of their predicted effect on binding affinity, which allows gains and losses to be evaluated independently along the two phylogenetic lineages. The observed patterns of polymorphism and divergence are not compatible with neutral evolution for either class of mutations. Instead, multiple lines of evidence are consistent with contributions of positive selection to TFBS gain and loss as well as purifying selection in its maintenance. In discussion, we propose a model to reconcile the finding of selection driving TFBS turnover with constrained CRM function over long evolutionary time.},

abstract = {Nucleosome organization is critical for gene regulation. In living cells this organization is determined by multiple factors, including the action of chromatin remodellers, competition with site-specific DNA-binding proteins, and the DNA sequence preferences of the nucleosomes themselves. However, it has been difficult to estimate the relative importance of each of these mechanisms in vivo, because in vivo nucleosome maps reflect the combined action of all influencing factors. Here we determine the importance of nucleosome DNA sequence preferences experimentally by measuring the genome-wide occupancy of nucleosomes assembled on purified yeast genomic DNA. The resulting map, in which nucleosome occupancy is governed only by the intrinsic sequence preferences of nucleosomes, is similar to in vivo nucleosome maps generated in three different growth conditions. In vitro, nucleosome depletion is evident at many transcription factor binding sites and around gene start and end sites, indicating that nucleosome depletion at these sites in vivo is partly encoded in the genome. We confirm these results with a micrococcal nuclease-independent experiment that measures the relative affinity of nucleosomes for approximately 40,000 double-stranded 150-base-pair oligonucleotides. Using our in vitro data, we devise a computational model of nucleosome sequence preferences that is significantly correlated with in vivo nucleosome occupancy in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our results indicate that the intrinsic DNA sequence preferences of nucleosomes have a central role in determining the organization of nucleosomes in vivo.},

abstract = {Progress in molecular genetics makes possible the development of alternative disease control strategies that target the competence of mosquitoes to transmit pathogens. We tested the regulatory region of the vitellogenin (Vg) gene of Aedes aegypti for its ability to express potential antipathogen factors in transgenic mosquitoes. Hermes-mediated transformation was used to integrate a 2.1-kb Vg-promoter fragment driving the expression of the Defensin A (DefA) coding region, one of the major insect immune factors. PCR amplification of genomic DNA and Southern blot analyses, carried out through the ninth generation, showed that the Vg-DefA transgene insertion was stable. The Vg-DefA transgene was strongly activated in the fat body by a blood meal. The mRNA levels reached a maximum at 24-h postblood meal, corresponding to the peak expression time of the endogenous Vg gene. High levels of transgenic defensin were accumulated in the hemolymph of bloodfed female mosquitoes, persisting for 20-22 days after a single blood feeding. Purified transgenic defensin showed antibacterial activity comparable to that of defensin isolated from bacterially challenged control mosquitoes. Thus, we have been able to engineer the genetically stable transgenic mosquito with an element of systemic immunity, which is activated through the blood meal-triggered cascade rather than by infection. This work represents a significant step toward the development of molecular genetic approaches to the control of vector competence in pathogen transmission.},

abstract = {The introduction of genes that impair Plasmodium development into mosquito populations is a strategy being considered for malaria control. The effect of the transgene on mosquito fitness is a crucial parameter influencing the success of this approach. We have previously shown that anopheline mosquitoes expressing the SM1 peptide in the midgut lumen are impaired for transmission of Plasmodium berghei. Moreover, the transgenic mosquitoes had no noticeable fitness load compared with nontransgenic mosquitoes when fed on noninfected mice. Here we show that when fed on mice infected with P. berghei, these transgenic mosquitoes are more fit (higher fecundity and lower mortality) than sibling nontransgenic mosquitoes. In cage experiments, transgenic mosquitoes gradually replaced nontransgenics when mosquitoes were maintained on mice infected with gametocyte-producing parasites (strain ANKA 2.34) but not when maintained on mice infected with gametocyte-deficient parasites (strain ANKA 2.33). These findings suggest that when feeding on Plasmodium-infected blood, transgenic malaria-resistant mosquitoes have a selective advantage over nontransgenic mosquitoes. This fitness advantage has important implications for devising malaria control strategies by means of genetic modification of mosquitoes.},

Adult female salivary glands are involved in pathogen transmission to human hosts and are target sites for expression of antipathogen effector molecules. The Aedes aegypti 30K a and 30K b genes are expressed exclusively in adult female salivary glands and are transcribed divergently from start sites separated by 263 nucleotides. The intergenic, 5'- and 3'-end untranslated regions of both genes are sufficient to express simultaneously two different transgene products in the distal-lateral lobes of the female salivary glands. An antidengue effector gene, membranes no protein (Mnp), driven by the 30K b promoter, expresses an inverted-repeat RNA with sequences derived from the premembrane protein-encoding region of the dengue virus serotype 2 genome and reduces significantly the prevalence and mean intensities of viral infection in mosquito salivary glands and saliva.},

abstract = {High-throughput genome sequencing techniques have now reached vector biology with an emphasis on those species that are vectors of human pathogens. The first mosquito to be sequenced was Anopheles gambiae, the vector for Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria. Further mosquitoes have followed: Aedes aegypti (yellow fever and dengue fever vector) and Culex pipiens (lymphatic filariasis and West Nile fever). Species that are currently in sequencing include the body louse Pediculus humanus (Typhus vector), the triatomine Rhodnius prolixus (Chagas disease vector) and the tick Ixodes scapularis (Lyme disease vector). The motivations for sequencing vector genomes are to further understand vector biology, with an eye on developing new control strategies (for example novel chemical attractants or repellents) or understanding the limitations of current strategies (for example the mechanism of insecticide resistance); to analyse the mechanisms driving their evolution; and to perform an exhaustive analysis of the gene repertory. The proliferation of genomic data creates the need for efficient and accessible storage. We present VectorBase, a genomic resource centre that is both involved in the annotation of vector genomes and act as a portal for access to the genomic information (http://www.vectorbase.org).},

abstract = {Nucleosome positioning plays an essential role in cellular processes by modulating accessibility of DNA to proteins. Here, using only sequence-dependent DNA flexibility and intrinsic curvature, we predict the nucleosome occupancy along the genomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster and demonstrate the predictive power and universality of our model through its correlation with experimentally determined nucleosome occupancy data. In yeast promoter regions, the computed average nucleosome occupancy closely superimposes with experimental data, exhibiting a <200 bp region unfavourable for nucleosome formation bordered by regions that facilitate nucleosome formation. In the fly, our model faithfully predicts promoter strength as encoded in distinct chromatin architectures characteristic of strongly and weakly expressed genes. We also predict that nucleosomes are repositioned by active mechanisms at the majority of fly promoters. Our model uses only basic physical properties to describe the wrapping of DNA around the histone core, yet it captures a substantial part of chromatin's structural complexity, thus leading to a much better prediction of nucleosome occupancy than methods based merely on periodic curved DNA motifs. Our results indicate that the physical properties of the DNA chain, and not just the regulatory factors and chromatin-modifying enzymes, play key roles in eukaryotic transcription.},

@article{Milenkovic2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recent explosion in biological and other real-world network data has created the need for improved tools for large network analyses. In addition to well established global network properties, several new mathematical techniques for analyzing local structural properties of large networks have been developed. Small over-represented subgraphs, called network motifs, have been introduced to identify simple building blocks of complex networks. Small induced subgraphs, called graphlets, have been used to develop "network signatures" that summarize network topologies. Based on these network signatures, two new highly sensitive measures of network local structural similarities were designed: the relative graphlet frequency distance (RGF-distance) and the graphlet degree distribution agreement (GDD-agreement). Finding adequate null-models for biological networks is important in many research domains. Network properties are used to assess the fit of network models to the data. Various network models have been proposed. To date, there does not exist a software tool that measures the above mentioned local network properties. Moreover, none of the existing tools compare real-world networks against a series of network models with respect to these local as well as a multitude of global network properties. RESULTS: Thus, we introduce GraphCrunch, a software tool that finds well-fitting network models by comparing large real-world networks against random graph models according to various network structural similarity measures. It has unique capabilities of finding computationally expensive RGF-distance and GDD-agreement measures. In addition, it computes several standard global network measures and thus supports the largest variety of network measures thus far. Also, it is the first software tool that compares real-world networks against a series of network models and that has built-in parallel computing capabilities allowing for a user specified list of machines on which to perform compute intensive searches for local network properties. Furthermore, GraphCrunch is easily extendible to include additional network measures and models. CONCLUSION: GraphCrunch is a software tool that implements the latest research on biological network models and properties: it compares real-world networks against a series of random graph models with respect to a multitude of local and global network properties. We present GraphCrunch as a comprehensive, parallelizable, and easily extendible software tool for analyzing and modeling large biological networks. The software is open-source and freely available at http://www.ics.uci.edu/\~{}bio-nets/graphcrunch/. It runs under Linux, MacOS, and Windows Cygwin. In addition, it has an easy to use on-line web user interface that is available from the above web page.},

abstract = {The malaria parasite, Plasmodium, has evolved an intricate life cycle that includes stages specific to a mosquito vector and to the vertebrate host. The mosquito midgut represents the first barrier Plasmodium parasites encounter following their ingestion with a blood meal from an infected vertebrate. Elucidation of the molecular interaction between the parasite and the mosquito could help identify novel approaches to preventing parasite development and subsequent transmission to vertebrates. We have used an integrated Bulked Segregant Analysis-Differential Display (BSA-DD) approach to target genes expressed that are in the midgut and located within two genome regions involved in determining susceptibility to P. gallinaceum in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. A total of twenty-two genes were identified and characterized, including five genes with no homologues in public sequence databases. Eight of these genes were mapped genetically to intervals on chromosome 2 that contain two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that determine susceptibility to infection by P. gallinaceum. Expression analysis revealed several expression patterns, and ten genes were specifically or preferentially expressed in the midgut of adult females. Real-time PCR quantification of expression with respect to the time of blood meal ingestion and infection status in mosquito strains permissive and refractory for malaria revealed a differential expression pattern for seven genes. These represent candidate genes that may influence the ability of the mosquito vector to support the development of Plasmodium parasites. Here we describe their isolation and discuss their putative roles in parasite-mosquito interactions and their use as potential targets in strategies designed to block transmission of malaria.},

abstract = {The variation of expression pattern exhibited by a transgene as a result of random integration, known as position effect, is, among other mechanisms, a particular challenge to reverse genetics. We present a strategy to counteract position effect in Arabidopsis thaliana by flanking the transgenes with the gypsy insulator from Drosophila melanogaster. In addition, Suppressor of Hairy-wing [Su(Hw)], the binding protein of the gypsy insulator, was coexpressed. Results indicated that the gypsy insulators could efficiently improve the expression levels of reporter genes driven by various kinds of promoters by 8- to 13-fold. Coexpression of the Su(Hw) protein led to a more uniform expression level of transgenes, as the coefficient of variation of expression levels was reduced further. The gypsy-Su(Hw) system enhanced expression levels, but did not alter the specificity of promoter activities, as experimentally evidenced by the promoters of the PIN and the AFB gene families. Interestingly, the gypsy insulator was also able to improve the expression of a selectable marker gene outside the insulated region, which facilitated the screen of transformants. Our system will likely decrease the number of lines that experimenters need to create and examine for a given transgene by contributing to relatively high and precise expression of transgenes in plants. Certain features of the gypsy insulator in Arabidopsis also provide new perspectives on the insulator field.},

abstract = {The discovery and mapping of cis-regulatory elements is important for understanding regulation of gene transcription in mosquito vectors of human diseases. Genome sequence data are available for 3 species, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, and Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae), representing 2 subfamilies (Culicinae and Anophelinae) that are estimated to have diverged 145 to 200 million years ago. Comparative genomics tools were used to screen genomic DNA fragments located in the 5'-end flanking regions of orthologous genes. These analyses resulted in the identification of 137 sequences, designated "mosquito motifs," 7 to 9 nucleotides in length, representing 18 families of putative cis-regulatory elements conserved significantly among the 3 species when compared to the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Forty-one of the motifs were implicated previously in experiments as sites for binding transcription factors or functioning in the regulation of mosquito gene expression. Further analyses revealed associations between specific motifs and expression profiles, particularly in those genes that show increased or decreased mRNA abundance in females following a blood meal, and those accumulating transcription products exclusively or preferentially in the midgut, fat bodies, or ovaries. These results validate the methodology and support a relationship between the discovered motifs and the conservation of hematophagy in mosquitoes.},

abstract = {Over 50\% of genes in Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest human malaria parasite, contain predicted introns, yet experimental characterization of splicing in this organism remains incomplete. We present here a transcriptome-wide characterization of intraerythrocytic splicing events, as captured by RNA-Seq data from four timepoints of a single highly synchronous culture. Gene model-independent analysis of these data in conjunction with publically available RNA-Seq data with HMMSplicer, an in-house developed splice site detection algorithm, revealed a total of 977 new 5' GU-AG 3' and 5 new 5' GC-AG 3' junctions absent from gene models and ESTs (11\% increase to the current annotation). In addition, 310 alternative splicing events were detected in 254 (4.5\%) genes, most of which truncate open reading frames. Splicing events antisense to gene models were also detected, revealing complex transcriptional arrangements within the parasite's transcriptome. Interestingly, antisense introns overlap sense introns more than would be expected by chance, perhaps indicating a functional relationship between overlapping transcripts or an inherent organizational property of the transcriptome. Independent experimental validation confirmed over 30 new antisense and alternative junctions. Thus, this largest assemblage of new and alternative splicing events to date in Plasmodium falciparum provides a more precise, dynamic view of the parasite's transcriptome.},

abstract = {Genetically engineered crops that produce insecticidal toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are grown widely for pest control. However, insect adaptation can reduce the toxins' efficacy. The predominant strategy for delaying pest resistance to Bt crops requires refuges of non-Bt host plants to provide susceptible insects to mate with resistant insects. Variable farmer compliance is one of the limitations of this approach. Here we report the benefits of an alternative strategy where sterile insects are released to mate with resistant insects and refuges are scarce or absent. Computer simulations show that this approach works in principle against pests with recessive or dominant inheritance of resistance. During a large-scale, four-year field deployment of this strategy in Arizona, resistance of pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella) to Bt cotton did not increase. A multitactic eradication program that included the release of sterile moths reduced pink bollworm abundance by >99\%, while eliminating insecticide sprays against this key invasive pest.},

Here, we show that in contrast to yeast, DNA at human promoters, enhancers, and TFBSs generally encodes high intrinsic nucleosome occupancy. In most cases we examined, these elements also have high experimentally measured nucleosome occupancy in vivo. These regions typically have high G+C content, which correlates positively with intrinsic nucleosome occupancy, and are depleted for nucleosome-excluding poly-A sequences. We propose that high nucleosome preference is directly encoded at regulatory sequences in the human genome to restrict access to regulatory information that will ultimately be utilized in only a subset of differentiated cells.},

The orthologs of these and other mouse Chr 17 genes are localized on Chr III of Caenorhabditis elegans, thus defining a syntenic group conserved between vertebrates and nonvertebrates. In human, mouse, and snake, the PDCD2-, and TATA-binding protein (TBP)-encoding genes are adjacent tail-to-tail. The TBP- and PDCD2-encoding genes are linked also in Drosophila, and, together with proteasomal subunit C5 gene, they are syntenic in human, mouse, C. elegans, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The orthologs of tightly linked C. elegans genes, coding for BRP44L and PDCD2, map to about 2-Mb interval on human region 6q27 and on mouse Chr 17. Hitherto, 13 members of synteny conserved between C. elegans and vertebrates have been detected, of which six are located on Drosophila Chr X. Such a distribution of transcription units is nonrandom and could indicate a long-range cis-acting relationship among the genes within the conserved syntenic group.},

abstract = {A balance between gene expression stability and evolvability is essential for the long-term maintenance of a living system. In this paper, we studied whether the genetic and epigenetic properties of the promoter affect gene expression variability. We hypothesized that upstream distance and orientation (head-to-head or head-to-tail) are important for the promoter architecture and gene expression variability. We found that in budding yeast genes with a short upstream distance tend to have low gene expression variability, and their promoter is flanked by strongly positioned nucleosomes and tends to have low nucleosome occupancy. These observations suggest that in vivo positioning of the flanking nucleosomes facilitates stable nucleosome depletion at the core promoter region and enhances gene expression stability. Head-to-head genes have, on average, lower gene expression variability, greater nucleosome depletion at the core promoter region, and more strongly positioned nucleosomes that flank the core promoter than do head-to-tail genes. These observations hold for diverse eukaryotes. In complex organisms such as mammals, only a small fraction of head-to-tail genes have retained a short upstream distance, probably because the promoter may not be flanked by a strongly positioned nucleosome on the upstream side.},

The study reveals the molecular components of several Anopheles processes relating to blood digestion, midgut expansion and response to Plasmodium-infected blood such as digestive enzymes, transporters, cytoskeletal and structural components and stress and immune responsive factors. In parallel, the analysis provide detailed expression patterns of Plasmodium genes encoding essential developmental and metabolic factors and proteins implicated in interaction with the mosquito vector and vertebrate host such as kinases, transcription and translational factors, cytoskeletal components and a variety of surface proteins, some of which are potent vaccine targets. Temporal correlation between transcription profiles of both organisms identifies putative gene clusters of interacting processes, such as Plasmodium invasion of the midgut epithelium, Anopheles immune responses to Plasmodium infection, and apoptosis and expulsion of invaded midgut cells from the epithelium. Intriguing transcription patterns for highly variable Plasmodium surface antigens may indicate parasite strategies to avoid recognition by the mosquito's immune surveillance system.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Tiling arrays have been the tool of choice for probing an organism's transcriptome without prior assumptions about the transcribed regions, but RNA-Seq is becoming a viable alternative as the costs of sequencing continue to decrease. Understanding the relative merits of these technologies will help researchers select the appropriate technology for their needs. RESULTS: Here, we compare these two platforms using a matched sample of poly(A)-enriched RNA isolated from the second larval stage of C. elegans. We find that the raw signals from these two technologies are reasonably well correlated but that RNA-Seq outperforms tiling arrays in several respects, notably in exon boundary detection and dynamic range of expression. By exploring the accuracy of sequencing as a function of depth of coverage, we found that about 4 million reads are required to match the sensitivity of two tiling array replicates. The effects of cross-hybridization were analyzed using a "nearest neighbor" classifier applied to array probes; we describe a method for determining potential "black list" regions whose signals are unreliable. Finally, we propose a strategy for using RNA-Seq data as a gold standard set to calibrate tiling array data. All tiling array and RNA-Seq data sets have been submitted to the modENCODE Data Coordinating Center. CONCLUSIONS: Tiling arrays effectively detect transcript expression levels at a low cost for many species while RNA-Seq provides greater accuracy in several regards. Researchers will need to carefully select the technology appropriate to the biological investigations they are undertaking. It will also be important to reconsider a comparison such as ours as sequencing technologies continue to evolve.},

@article{Aksoy2001,
abstract = {The extensive antigenic variation phenomena African trypanosomes display in their mammalian host have hampered efforts to develop effective vaccines against trypanosomiasis. Human disease management aims largely to treat infected hosts by chemotherapy, whereas control of animal diseases relies on reducing tsetse populations as well as on drug therapy. The control strategies for animal diseases are carried out and financed by livestock owners, who have an obvious economic incentive. Sustaining largely insecticide-based control at a local level and relying on drugs for treatment of infected hosts for a disease for which there is no evidence of acquired immunity could prove extremely costly in the long run. It is more likely that a combination of several methods in an integrated, phased and area-wide approach would be more effective in controlling these diseases and subsequently improving agricultural output. New approaches that are environmentally acceptable, efficacious and affordable are clearly desirable for control of various medically and agriculturally important insects including tsetse. Here, Serap Aksoy and colleagues discuss molecular genetic approaches to modulate tsetse vector competence.},

abstract = {Vector-borne diseases constitute an enormous burden on public health across the world. However, despite the importance of interactions between infectious pathogens and their respective vector for disease transmission, the biology of the pathogen in the insect is often less well understood than the forms that cause human infections. Even with the global impact of Plasmodium parasites, the causative agents of malarial disease, no vaccine exists to prevent infection and resistance to all frontline drugs is emerging. Malaria parasite migration through the mosquito host constitutes a major population bottleneck of the lifecycle and therefore represents a powerful, although as yet relatively untapped, target for therapeutic intervention. The understanding of parasite-mosquito interactions has increased in recent years with developments in genome-wide approaches, genomics and proteomics. Each development has shed significant light on the biology of the malaria parasite during the mosquito phase of the lifecycle. Less well understood, however, is the process of midgut colonisation and oocyst formation, the precursor to parasite re-infection from the next mosquito bite. Here, we review the current understanding of cellular and molecular events underlying midgut colonisation centred on the role of the motile ookinete. Further insight into the major interactions between the parasite and the mosquito will help support the broader goal to identify targets for transmission-blocking therapies against malarial disease.},

@article{Bahia2010,
abstract = {Malaria affects 300 million people worldwide every year and is endemic in 22 countries in the Americas where transmission occurs mainly in the Amazon Region. Most malaria cases in the Americas are caused by Plasmodium vivax, a parasite that is almost impossible to cultivate in vitro, and Anopheles aquasalis is an important malaria vector. Understanding the interactions between this vector and its parasite will provide important information for development of disease control strategies. To this end, we performed mRNA subtraction experiments using A. aquasalis 2 and 24 hours after feeding on blood and blood from malaria patients infected with P. vivax to identify changes in the mosquito vector gene induction that could be important during the initial steps of infection. A total of 2,138 clones of differentially expressed genes were sequenced and 496 high quality unique sequences were obtained. Annotation revealed 36\% of sequences unrelated to genes in any database, suggesting that they were specific to A. aquasalis. A high number of sequences (59\%) with no matches in any databases were found 24 h after infection. Genes related to embryogenesis were down-regulated in insects infected by P. vivax. Only a handful of genes related to immune responses were detected in our subtraction experiment. This apparent weak immune response of A. aquasalis to P. vivax infection could be related to the susceptibility of this vector to this important human malaria parasite. Analysis of some genes by real time PCR corroborated and expanded the subtraction results. Taken together, these data provide important new information about this poorly studied American malaria vector by revealing differences between the responses of A. aquasalis to P. vivax infection, in relation to better studied mosquito-Plasmodium pairs. These differences may be important for the development of malaria transmission-blocking strategies in the Americas.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies have enabled the sequencing of several individual human genomes. These technologies are also being used in novel ways for mRNA expression profiling, genome-wide discovery of transcription-factor binding sites, small RNA discovery, etc. The multitude of sequencing platforms, each with their unique characteristics, pose a number of design challenges, regarding the technology to be used and the depth of sequencing required for a particular sequencing application. Here we describe a number of analytical and empirical results to address design questions for two applications: detection of structural variations from paired-end sequencing and estimating mRNA transcript abundance. RESULTS: For structural variation, our results provide explicit trade-offs between the detection and resolution of rearrangement breakpoints, and the optimal mix of paired-read insert lengths. Specifically, we prove that optimal detection and resolution of breakpoints is achieved using a mix of exactly two insert library lengths. Further- more, we derive explicit formulae to determine these insert length combinations, enabling a 15\% improvement in breakpoint detection at the same experimental cost. On empirical short read data, these predictions show good concordance with Illumina 200bp and 2Kbp insert length libraries. For transcriptome sequencing, we determine the sequencing depth needed to detect rare transcripts from a small pilot study. With only 1 Million reads, we derive corrections that enable almost perfect prediction of the underlying expression probability distribution, and use this to predict the sequencing depth required to detect low expressed genes with greater than 95\% probability. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our results form a generic framework for many design considerations related to high- throughput sequencing. We provide software tools (http://bix.ucsd.edu/projects/NGS-DesignTools) to derive platform independent guidelines for designing sequencing experiments (amount of sequencing, choice of insert length, mix of libraries) for novel applications of next generation sequencing.},

@article{Bauer2010,
abstract = {The interpretation of data-driven experiments in genomics often involves a search for biological categories that are enriched for the responder genes identified by the experiments. However, knowledge bases such as the Gene Ontology (GO) contain hundreds or thousands of categories with very high overlap between categories. Thus, enrichment analysis performed on one category at a time frequently returns large numbers of correlated categories, leaving the choice of the most relevant ones to the user's; interpretation. Here we present model-based gene set analysis (MGSA) that analyzes all categories at once by embedding them in a Bayesian network, in which gene response is modeled as a function of the activation of biological categories. Probabilistic inference is used to identify the active categories. The Bayesian modeling approach naturally takes category overlap into account and avoids the need for multiple testing corrections met in single-category enrichment analysis. On simulated data, MGSA identifies active categories with up to 95\% precision at a recall of 20\% for moderate settings of noise, leading to a 10-fold precision improvement over single-category statistical enrichment analysis. Application to a gene expression data set in yeast demonstrates that the method provides high-level, summarized views of core biological processes and correctly eliminates confounding associations.},

abstract = {Dengue is an emerging tropical disease infecting tens of millions of people annually. A febrile illness with potentially severe hemorrhagic manifestations, dengue is caused by mosquito-borne viruses (DENV-1 to -4) that are maintained in endemic transmission in large urban centers of the tropics with periodic epidemic cycles at 3- to 5-year intervals. Puerto Rico (PR), a major population center in the Caribbean, has experienced increasingly severe epidemics since multiple dengue serotypes were introduced beginning in the late 1970s. We document the phylodynamics of DENV-4 between 1981 and 1998, a period of dramatic ecological expansion during which evolutionary change also occurs. The timescale of viral evolution is sufficiently short that viral transmission dynamics can be elucidated from genetic diversity data. Specifically, by combining virus sequence data with confirmed case counts in PR over these two decades, we show that the pattern of cyclic epidemics is strongly correlated with coalescent estimates of effective population size that have been estimated from sampled virus sequences using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Thus, we show that the observed epidemiologic dynamics are correlated with similar fluctuations in diversity, including severe interepidemic reductions in genetic diversity compatible with population bottlenecks that may greatly impact DENV evolutionary dynamics. Mean effective population sizes based on genetic data appear to increase prior to isolation counts, suggesting a potential bias in the latter and justifying more active surveillance of DENV activity. Our analysis explicitly integrates epidemiologic and sequence data in a joint model that could be used to further explore transmission models of infectious disease.},

Here we report the identification of a GATA factor that is synthesized after a blood meal and acts as a transcriptional activator of vitellogenin (Vg), and the identification of an S6 kinase that is a transcription regulator of the amino acid signaling pathway. Tick GATA mRNA accumulated in the midgut prior to blood feeding. However, translation of GATA was activated by blood feeding because the GATA protein dramatically increased in the fat body of engorged females. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of S6 kinase and GATA factor revealed the involvements of S6 kinase in GATA activation and resulted in a significant inhibition of the major yolk protein vitellogenin in engorged ticks and effectively disrupting egg development after a blood meal. These results indicate that the GATA factor, a specific transcriptional activator of Vg gene, represents an important molecule for the regulation of tick vitellogenesis and reproduction.},

abstract = {Dengue fever is the most important arboviral disease world-wide, with Aedes aegypti being the major vector. Interactions between the mosquito host and dengue viruses (DENV) are complex and vector competence varies among geographically-distinct Ae. aegypti populations. Additionally, dengue is caused by four antigenically-distinct viral serotypes (DENV1-4), each with multiple genotypes. Each virus genotype interacts differently with vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Analyses of alterations in mosquito transcriptional profiles during DENV infection are expected to provide the basis for identifying networks of genes involved in responses to viruses and contribute to the molecular-genetic understanding of vector competence. In addition, this knowledge is anticipated to support the development of novel disease-control strategies. RNA-seq technology was used to assess genome-wide changes in transcript abundance at 1, 4 and 14 days following DENV2 infection in carcasses, midguts and salivary glands of the Ae. aegypti Chetumal strain. DENV2 affected the expression of 397 Ae. aegypti genes, most of which were down-regulated by viral infection. Differential accumulation of transcripts was mainly tissue- and time-specific. Comparisons of our data with other published reports reveal conservation of functional classes, but limited concordance of specific mosquito genes responsive to DENV2 infection. These results indicate the necessity of additional studies of mosquito-DENV interactions, specifically those focused on recently-derived mosquito strains with multiple dengue virus serotypes and genotypes.},

abstract = {Transcriptional networks orchestrate complex developmental processes. Such networks are commonly instigated by master regulators of development. Considerable progress has been made in elucidating GATA factor-dependent genetic networks that control blood cell development. GATA-2 is required for the genesis and/or function of hematopoietic stem cells, whereas GATA-1 drives the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors into a subset of the blood cell lineages. GATA-1 directly represses Gata2 transcription, and this involves GATA-1-mediated displacement of GATA-2 from chromatin, a process termed a GATA switch. GATA switches occur at numerous loci with critical functions, indicating that they are widely utilized developmental control tools.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Transcription factors (TFs) are crucial during the lifetime of the cell. Their functional roles are defined by the genes they regulate. Uncovering these roles not only sheds light on the TF at hand but puts it into the context of the complete regulatory network. RESULTS: Here, we present an alignment- and threshold-free comparative genomics approach for assigning functional roles to DNA regulatory motifs. We incorporate our approach into the Gomo algorithm, a computational tool for detecting associations between a user-specified DNA regulatory motif [expressed as a position weight matrix (PWM)] and Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Incorporating multiple species into the analysis significantly improves Gomo's ability to identify GO terms associated with the regulatory targets of TFs. Including three comparative species in the process of predicting TF roles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens increases the number of significant predictions by 75 and 200\%, respectively. The predicted GO terms are also more specific, yielding deeper biological insight into the role of the TF. Adjusting motif (binding) affinity scores for individual sequence composition proves to be essential for avoiding false positive associations. We describe a novel DNA sequence-scoring algorithm that compensates a thermodynamic measure of DNA-binding affinity for individual sequence base composition. GOMO's prediction accuracy proves to be relatively insensitive to how promoters are defined. Because GOMO uses a threshold-free form of gene set analysis, there are no free parameters to tune. Biologists can investigate the potential roles of DNA regulatory motifs of interest using GOMO via the web (http://meme.nbcr.net).},

Most mosquitoes are dead ends for the parasite, and only limited ranges of Anopheles are able to transmit Plasmodium to humans.

Here, we review key factors of vectorial capacity and competence in Anopheles, with a particular focus on the most important malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. We aim to point out selection pressures exerted by Plasmodium on Anopheles to improve its own transmission and discuss how the parasite might shape the vector to its benefit.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The control of mosquitoes transmitting infectious diseases relies mainly on the use of chemical insecticides. However, mosquito control programs are now threatened by the emergence of insecticide resistance. Hitherto, most research efforts have been focused on elucidating the molecular basis of inherited resistance. Less attention has been paid to the short-term response of mosquitoes to insecticides and pollutants which could have a significant impact on insecticide efficacy. Here, a combination of LongSAGE and Solexa sequencing was used to perform a deep transcriptome analysis of larvae of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti exposed for 48 h to sub-lethal doses of three chemical insecticides and three anthropogenic pollutants. RESULTS: Thirty millions 20 bp cDNA tags were sequenced, mapped to the mosquito genome and clustered, representing 6850 known genes and 4868 additional clusters not located within predicted genes. Mosquitoes exposed to insecticides or anthropogenic pollutants showed considerable modifications of their transcriptome. Genes encoding cuticular proteins, transporters, and enzymes involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and detoxification processes were particularly affected. Genes and molecular mechanisms potentially involved in xenobiotic response and insecticide tolerance were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The method used in the present study appears as a powerful approach for investigating fine transcriptome variations in genome-sequenced organisms and can provide useful informations for the detection of novel transcripts. At the biological level, despite low concentrations and no apparent phenotypic effects, the significant impact of these xenobiotics on mosquito transcriptomes raise important questions about the 'hidden impact' of anthropogenic pollutants on ecosystems and consequences on vector control.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria transmission is now recognized as a key target for intervention. Evaluation of the Plasmodium oocyst burden in the midguts of Anopheles spp. is important for many of assays investigating transmission. However, current assays are very time-consuming, manually demanding and patently subject to observer-observer variation. METHODS: This report presents the development of a method to rapidly, accurately and consistently determine oocyst burdens on mosquito midguts using GFP-expressing Plasmodium berghei and a custom-written macro for ImageJ. The counting macro was optimized and found to be fit-for-purpose by performing gametocyte membrane feeds with parasite infected blood. Dissected midguts were counted both manually and using the automated macro, then compared. The optimized settings for the macro were then validated by using it to determine the transmission blocking efficacies of two anti-malarial compounds - dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and lumefantrine, in comparison to manually determined analysis of the same experiment. RESULTS: Concurrence of manual and macro counts was very high (R2 = 0.973) and reproducible. Estimated transmission blocking efficacies between manual and automated analysis were highly concordant, indicating that dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate has little or no transmission blocking potential, whilst lumefantrine strongly inhibits sporogony. CONCLUSION: Recognizing a potential five-fold increase in throughput, the resulting reduction in personnel costs, and the absence of inter-operator/laboratory variation possible with this approach, this counting macro may be a benefit to the malaria community.},

This provides a versatile motif discovery framework, across all data types and genomes, with exceptional sensitivity and near-zero false-positive rates.

Clusters of granules are present at the surface of the nucleolus and free in the nucleoplasm. Tentative results indicate that they may contain DNA.

Present mosquito control methods are not sufficiently effective and new approaches are needed urgently. A "sterile-male-release" strategy based on the release of mosquitoes carrying a conditional dominant lethal gene is an attractive new control methodology. Transgenic strains of Aedes aegypti were engineered to have a repressible female-specific flightless phenotype using either two separate transgenes or a single transgene, based on the use of a female-specific indirect flight muscle promoter from the Aedes aegypti Actin-4 gene. These strains eliminate the need for sterilization by irradiation, permit male-only release ("genetic sexing"), and enable the release of eggs instead of adults. Furthermore, these strains are expected to facilitate area-wide control or elimination of dengue if adopted as part of an integrated pest management strategy.},

abstract = {It is well established that epigenetic modulation of genome accessibility in chromatin occurs during biological processes. Here we describe a method based on restriction enzymes and next-generation sequencing for identifying accessible DNA elements using a small amount of starting material, and use it to examine myeloid differentiation of primary human CD34+ cells. The accessibility of several classes of cis-regulatory elements was a predictive marker of in vivo DNA binding by transcription factors, and was associated with distinct patterns of histone posttranslational modifications. We also mapped large chromosomal domains with differential accessibility in progenitors and maturing cells. Accessibility became restricted during differentiation, correlating with a decreased number of expressed genes and loss of regulatory potential. Our data suggest that a permissive chromatin structure in multipotent cells is progressively and selectively closed during differentiation, and illustrate the use of our method for the identification of functional cis-regulatory elements.},

abstract = {Transcription factor binding sites are being discovered at a rapid pace. It is now necessary to turn attention towards understanding how these sites work in combination to influence gene expression. Quantitative models that accurately predict gene expression from promoter sequence will be a crucial part of solving this problem. Here we present such a model, based on the analysis of synthetic promoter libraries in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Thermodynamic models based only on the equilibrium binding of transcription factors to DNA and to each other captured a large fraction of the variation in expression in every library. Thermodynamic analysis of these libraries uncovered several phenomena in our system, including cooperativity and the effects of weak binding sites. When applied to the S. cerevisiae genome, a model of repression by Mig1 (which was trained on synthetic promoters) predicts a number of Mig1-regulated genes that lack significant Mig1-binding sites in their promoters. The success of the thermodynamic approach suggests that the information encoded by combinations of cis-regulatory sites is interpreted primarily through simple protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, with complicated biochemical reactions-such as nucleosome modifications-being downstream events. Quantitative analyses of synthetic promoter libraries will be an important tool in unravelling the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation.},

abstract = {In flies, small silencing RNAs are sorted between Argonaute1 (Ago1), the central protein component of the microRNA (miRNA) pathway, and Argonaute2 (Ago2), which mediates RNA interference. Extensive double-stranded character-as is found in small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)-directs duplexes into Ago2, whereas central mismatches, like those found in miRNA/miRNA* duplexes, direct duplexes into Ago1. Central to this sorting decision is the affinity of the small RNA duplex for the Dcr-2/R2D2 heterodimer, which loads small RNAs into Ago2. Here, we show that while most Drosophila miRNAs are bound to Ago1, miRNA* strands accumulate bound to Ago2. Like siRNA loading, efficient loading of miRNA* strands in Ago2 favors duplexes with a paired central region and requires both Dcr-2 and R2D2. Those miRNA and miRNA* sequences bound to Ago2, like siRNAs diced in vivo from long double-stranded RNA, typically begin with cytidine, whereas Ago1-bound miRNA and miRNA* disproportionately begin with uridine. Consequently, some pre-miRNA generate two or more isoforms from the same side of the stem that differentially partition between Ago1 and Ago2. Our findings provide the first genome-wide test for the idea that Drosophila small RNAs are sorted between Ago1 and Ago2 according to their duplex structure and the identity of their first nucleotide.},

abstract = {Disruptive selection mediated by predation on aquatic immature stages has been proposed as a major force driving ecological divergence and fostering speciation between the M and S molecular forms of the African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae. In the dry savannahs of West Africa where both molecular forms co-occur, the S form thrives in temporary pools filled with rainwater, whereas the M form preferentially breeds in permanent freshwater habitats where predator pressure is higher. Here, we explored the proximal mechanisms by which predation may contribute to habitat segregation between molecular forms using progeny of female mosquitoes captured in Burkina Faso. We show that the S form suffers higher predation rates than the M form when simultaneously exposed to the widespread predator, Anisops jaczewskii in an experimental arena. Furthermore, behavioral plasticity induced by exposure to the predator was observed in the M form, but not in the S form, and may partially explain its habitat use and ecological divergence from the S form. We discuss the role of adaptive phenotypic plasticity in allowing successful colonization of a new ecological niche by the M form and highlight further research areas that need to be addressed for a better understanding of the ultimate mechanisms underlying ecological speciation in this pest of major medical importance.},

abstract = {As an increasing number of eukaryotic genomes are being sequenced, comparative studies aimed at detecting regulatory elements in intergenic sequences are becoming more prevalent. Most comparative methods for transcription factor (TF) binding site discovery make use of global or local alignments of orthologous regulatory regions to assess whether a particular DNA site is conserved across related organisms, and thus more likely to be functional. Since binding sites are usually short, sometimes degenerate, and often independent of orientation, alignment algorithms may not align them correctly. Here, we present a novel, alignment-free approach for using conservation information for TF binding site discovery. We relax the definition of conserved sites: we consider a DNA site within a regulatory region to be conserved in an orthologous sequence if it occurs anywhere in that sequence, irrespective of orientation. We use this definition to derive informative priors over DNA sequence positions, and incorporate these priors into a Gibbs sampling algorithm for motif discovery. Our approach is simple and fast. It requires neither sequence alignments nor the phylogenetic relationships between the orthologous sequences, yet it is more effective on real biological data than methods that do.},

abstract = {To understand most cellular processes, one must understand how genetic information is processed. A formidable challenge is the dissection of gene regulatory networks to delineate how eukaryotic cells coordinate and govern patterns of gene expression that ultimately lead to a phenotype. In this paper, we review several approaches for modeling eukaryotic gene regulatory networks and for reverse engineering such networks from experimental observations. Since we are interested in elucidating the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of colon cancer progression, we use this important biological problem to illustrate various aspects of modeling gene regulation. We discuss four important models: gene networks, transcriptional regulatory systems, Boolean networks, and dynamical Bayesian networks. We review state-of-the-art functional genomics techniques, such as gene expression profiling, cis-regulatory element identification, TF target gene identification, and gene silencing by RNA interference, which can be used to extract information about gene regulation. We can employ this information, in conjunction with appropriately designed reverse engineering algorithms, to construct a computational model of gene regulation that sufficiently predicts experimental observations. In the last part of this review, we focus on the problem of reverse engineering transcriptional regulatory networks by gene perturbations. We mathematically formulate this problem and discuss the role of experimental resolution in our ability to reconstruct accurate models of gene regulation. We conclude, by discussing a promising approach for inferring a transcriptional regulatory system from microarray data obtained by gene perturbations.},

We used both methods to get more insight into the transcriptional control of myogenesis, studying differential gene expression in differentiated and proliferating C2C12 myoblast cells with statistical evaluation of reproducibility and differential gene expression. Both CAGE and SAGE provided highly reproducible data (Pearson's correlations >0.92 among biological triplicates).

However, despite the availability of a large number of algorithms, their strengths and weaknesses are not sufficiently understood. Here, we designed a comprehensive set of performance measures and benchmarked five modern sequence-based motif discovery algorithms using large datasets generated from Escherichia coli RegulonDB. Factors that affect the prediction accuracy, scalability and reliability are characterized. It is revealed that the nucleotide and the binding site level accuracy are very low, while the motif level accuracy is relatively high, which indicates that the algorithms can usually capture at least one correct motif in an input sequence. To exploit diverse predictions from multiple runs of one or more algorithms, a consensus ensemble algorithm has been developed, which achieved 6-45\% improvement over the base algorithms by increasing both the sensitivity and specificity. Our study illustrates limitations and potentials of existing sequence-based motif discovery algorithms. Taking advantage of the revealed potentials, several promising directions for further improvements are discussed. Since the sequence-based algorithms are the baseline of most of the modern motif discovery algorithms, this paper suggests substantial improvements would be possible for them.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Natural selection eliminates detrimental and favors advantageous phenotypes. This process leaves characteristic signatures in underlying genomic segments that can be recognized through deviations in allelic or haplotypic frequency spectra. To provide an identifiable signature of recent positive selection that can be detected by comparison with the background distribution, we introduced a new way of looking at genomic polymorphisms: haplotype allelic classes. RESULTS: The model combines segregating sites and haplotypic information in order to reveal useful data characteristics. We developed a summary statistic, Svd, to compare the distribution of the haplotypes carrying the selected allele with the distribution of the remaining ones. Coalescence simulations are used to study the distributions under standard population models assuming neutrality, demographic scenarios and selection models. To test, in practice, haplotype allelic class performance and the derived statistic in capturing deviation from neutrality due to positive selection, we analyzed haplotypic variation in detail in the locus of lactase persistence in the three HapMap Phase II populations. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that the Svd statistic is less sensitive than other tests to confounding factors such as demography or recombination. Our approach succeeds in identifying candidate loci, such as the lactase-persistence locus, as targets of strong positive selection and provides a new tool complementary to other tests to study natural selection in genomic data.},

abstract = {The GATA motif is a well known positive cis -regulatory element in vertebrates. In this work we report experimental evidence for the direct participation of a GATA motif in the expression of the Drosophila antibacterial peptide gene Cecropin A1 . Previously we have shown that a kappaB-like site is necessary for Cecropin A1 gene expression. Here we present evidence that the Drosophila Rel protein which binds to the kappaB-like site requires an intact GATA site for maximal Dif-mediated transactivation of the Cecropin A1 gene. We show that a Drosophila blood cell line contains factors binding specifically to the GATA motif of the Cecropin A1 gene. The GATA binding activity is likely to include member(s) of the GATA family of transcriptional regulators. We show that the promoters of several inducible insect immune genes possess GATA sites 0-12 base pairs away from kappaB-like sites in functionally important promoter regions. Clusters of GATA and kappaB sites are also observed in the promoters of two important mammalian immune genes, namely IL6 and IL3. The consistent proximity of GATA and kappaB sites appears to be a common theme in the immune gene expression of insects and mammals.},

abstract = {cis-regulatory DNA sequences known as enhancers control gene expression in space and time. They are central to metazoan development and are often responsible for changes in gene regulation that contribute to phenotypic evolution. Here, we examine the sequence, function, and genomic location of enhancers controlling tissue- and cell-type specific expression of the yellow gene in six Drosophila species. yellow is required for the production of dark pigment, and its expression has evolved largely in concert with divergent pigment patterns. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a transgenic host, we examined the expression of reporter genes in which either 5' intergenic or intronic sequences of yellow from each species controlled the expression of Green Fluorescent Protein. Surprisingly, we found that sequences controlling expression in the wing veins, as well as sequences controlling expression in epidermal cells of the abdomen, thorax, and wing, were located in different genomic regions in different species. By contrast, sequences controlling expression in bristle-associated cells were located in the intron of all species. Differences in the precise pattern of spatial expression within the developing epidermis of D. melanogaster transformants usually correlated with adult pigmentation in the species from which the cis-regulatory sequences were derived, which is consistent with cis-regulatory evolution affecting yellow expression playing a central role in Drosophila pigmentation divergence. Sequence comparisons among species favored a model in which sequential nucleotide substitutions were responsible for the observed changes in cis-regulatory architecture. Taken together, these data demonstrate frequent changes in yellow cis-regulatory architecture among Drosophila species. Similar analyses of other genes, combining in vivo functional tests of enhancer activity with in silico comparative genomics, are needed to determine whether the pattern of regulatory evolution we observed for yellow is characteristic of genes with rapidly evolving expression patterns.},

We develop a computational framework for this task, whose features include a new statistical score for motif scanning, the use of different scores for predicting targets of different motifs, and new ways to deal with redundancies among significant motif-function associations. This framework is applied to the recently sequenced genome of the jewel wasp, Nasonia vitripennis, making use of the existing knowledge of motifs and gene annotations in another insect genome, that of the fruitfly. The framework uses cross-species comparison to improve the specificity of its predictions, and does so without relying upon non-coding sequence alignment. It is therefore well suited for comparative genomics across large evolutionary divergences, where existing alignment-based methods are not applicable. We also apply the framework to find motifs associated with socially regulated gene sets in the honeybee, Apis mellifera, using comparisons with Nasonia, a solitary species, to identify honeybee-specific associations.},

abstract = {To overcome burden of mosquito-borne diseases, multiple control strategies are needed. Population replacement with genetically modified mosquitoes carrying antipathogen effector genes is one of the possible approaches for controlling disease transmission. However, transgenic mosquitoes with antipathogen phenotypes based on overexpression of a single type effector molecule are not efficient in interrupting pathogen transmission. Here, we show that co-overexpression of two antimicrobial peptides (AMP), Cecropin A, and Defensin A, in transgenic Aedes aegypti mosquitoes results in the cooperative antibacterial and antiPlasmodium action of these AMPs. The transgenic hybrid mosquitoes that overexpressed both Cecropin A and Defensin A under the control of the vitellogenin promoter exhibited an elevated resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, indicating that these AMPs acted cooperatively against this pathogenic bacterium. In these mosquitoes infected with P. gallinaceum, the number of oocysts was dramatically reduced in midguts, and no sporozoites were found in their salivary glands when the mosquitoes were fed twice to reactivate transgenic AMP production. Infection experiments using the transgenic hybrid mosquitoes, followed by sequential feeding on naive chicken, and then naive wild-type mosquitoes showed that the Plasmodium transmission was completely blocked. This study suggests an approach in generating transgenic mosquitoes with antiPlasmodium refractory phenotype, which is coexpression of two or more effector molecules with cooperative action on the parasite.},

While several reliable algorithms are available for automated SNV detection, the automated detection of microindels in deep short-read data presents a new bioinformatics challenge. RESULTS: We systematically analyzed how the short-read mapping tools MAQ, Bowtie, Burrows-Wheeler alignment tool (BWA), Novoalign and RazerS perform on simulated datasets that contain indels and evaluated how indels affect error rates in SNV detection. We implemented a simple algorithm to compute the equivalent indel region eir, which can be used to process the alignments produced by the mapping tools in order to perform indel calling. Using simulated data that contains indels, we demonstrate that indel detection works well on short-read data: the detection rate for microindels (<4 bp) is >90\%. Our study provides insights into systematic errors in SNV detection that is based on ungapped short sequence read alignments. Gapped alignments of short sequence reads can be used to reduce this error and to detect microindels in simulated short-read data. A comparison with microindels automatically identified on the ABI Sanger and Roche 454 platform indicates that microindel detection from short sequence reads identifies both overlapping and distinct indels.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Time-course microarray experiments can produce useful data which can help in understanding the underlying dynamics of the system. Clustering is an important stage in microarray data analysis where the data is grouped together according to certain characteristics. The majority of clustering techniques are based on distance or visual similarity measures which may not be suitable for clustering of temporal microarray data where the sequential nature of time is important. We present a Granger causality based technique to cluster temporal microarray gene expression data, which measures the interdependence between two time-series by statistically testing if one time-series can be used for forecasting the other time-series or not. RESULTS: A gene-association matrix is constructed by testing temporal relationships between pairs of genes using the Granger causality test. The association matrix is further analyzed using a graph-theoretic technique to detect highly connected components representing interesting biological modules. We test our approach on synthesized datasets and real biological datasets obtained for Arabidopsis thaliana. We show the effectiveness of our approach by analyzing the results using the existing biological literature. We also report interesting structural properties of the association network commonly desired in any biological system. CONCLUSIONS: Our experiments on synthesized and real microarray datasets show that our approach produces encouraging results. The method is simple in implementation and is statistically traceable at each step. The method can produce sets of functionally related genes which can be further used for reverse-engineering of gene circuits.},

abstract = {Our goal is to cluster genes into transcriptional modules--sets of genes where similarity in expression is explained by common regulatory mechanisms at the transcriptional level. We want to learn modules from both time series gene expression data and genome-wide motif data that are now readily available for organisms such as S. cereviseae as a result of prior computational studies or experimental results. We present a generative probabilistic model for combining regulatory sequence and time series expression data to cluster genes into coherent transcriptional modules. Starting with a set of motifs representing known or putative regulatory elements (transcription factor binding sites) and the counts of occurrences of these motifs in each gene's promoter region, together with a time series expression profile for each gene, the learning algorithm uses expectation maximization to learn module assignments based on both types of data. We also present a technique based on the Jensen-Shannon entropy contributions of motifs in the learned model for associating the most significant motifs to each module. Thus, the algorithm gives a global approach for associating sets of regulatory elements to "modules" of genes with similar time series expression profiles. The model for expression data exploits our prior belief of smooth dependence on time by using statistical splines and is suitable for typical time course data sets with relatively few experiments. Moreover, the model is sufficiently interpretable that we can understand how both sequence data and expression data contribute to the cluster assignments, and how to interpolate between the two data sources. We present experimental results on the yeast cell cycle to validate our method and find that our combined expression and motif clustering algorithm discovers modules with both coherent expression and similar motif patterns, including binding motifs associated to known cell cycle transcription factors.},

A subset of 19 CRMs validated as functional in the assay. The rate of predictive success reveals striking limitations of computational regulatory sequence analysis methods for CRM discovery. Motif-based methods performed no better than predictions based only on sequence conservation. Analysis of the properties of the functional sequences relative to inactive sequences identifies nucleotide sequence composition can be an important characteristic to incorporate in future methods for improved predictive specificity. Muscle-related TFBSs predicted within the functional sequences display greater sequence conservation than non-TFBS flanking regions.

abstract = {There is a growing interest in the evolution of transcription factor binding sites and corresponding functional change of transcriptional regulation. In this context, we have examined the structural changes of the ADF-1 binding sites at the Adh promoters of Drosophila funebris and D. virilis. We detected an expanded footprinted region in D. funebris that contains various adjacent binding sites with different binding affinities. ADF-1 was described to direct sequence-specific DNA binding to sites consisting of the multiple trinucleotide repeat . The ADF-1 recognition sites with high binding affinity differ from this trinucleotide repeat consensus sequence and a new consensus sequence is proposed for the high-affinity ADF-1 binding sites. In vitro transcription experiments with the D. funebris and D. virilis ADF-1 binding regions revealed that stronger ADF-1 binding to the expanded D. funebris ADF-1 binding region only moderately lead to increased transcriptional activity of the Adh gene. The potential of this regional expansion is discussed in the context of different ADF-1 cellular concentrations and maintenance of the ADF-1 stimulus. Altogether, evolutionary change of ADF-1 binding regions involves both, rearrangements of complex binding site cluster and also nucleotide substitutions within sites that lead to different binding affinities.},

However, it is cumbersome to identify functional motifs within enhancers, and thus few vertebrate enhancers have their core functional motifs revealed. Here we report a combined experimental and computational approach for discovering regulatory motifs in developmental enhancers. Making use of the zebrafish gene expression database, we computationally identified conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) likely to have a desired tissue-specificity based on the expression of nearby genes. Through a high throughput and robust enhancer assay, we tested the activity of approximately 100 such CNEs and efficiently uncovered developmental enhancers with desired spatial and temporal expression patterns in the zebrafish brain. Application of de novo motif prediction algorithms on a group of forebrain enhancers identified five top-ranked motifs, all of which were experimentally validated as critical for forebrain enhancer activity. These results demonstrate a systematic approach to discover important regulatory motifs in vertebrate developmental enhancers.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Time-course gene expression datasets provide important insights into dynamic aspects of biological processes, such as circadian rhythms, cell cycle and organ development. In a typical microarray time-course experiment, measurements are obtained at each time point from multiple replicate samples. Accurately recovering the gene expression patterns from experimental observations is made challenging by both measurement noise and variation among replicates' rates of development. Prior work on this topic has focused on inference of expression patterns assuming that the replicate times are synchronized. We develop a statistical approach that simultaneously infers both (i) the underlying (hidden) expression profile for each gene, as well as (ii) the biological time for each individual replicate. Our approach is based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) combined with a probabilistic model that accounts for uncertainty about the biological development time of each replicate. RESULTS: We apply GPR with uncertain measurement times to a microarray dataset of mRNA expression for the hair-growth cycle in mouse back skin, predicting both profile shapes and biological times for each replicate. The predicted time shifts show high consistency with independently obtained morphological estimates of relative development. We also show that the method systematically reduces prediction error on out-of-sample data, significantly reducing the mean squared error in a cross-validation study.

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Mosquito transgenesis offers new promises for the genetic control of vector-borne infectious diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. Genetic control strategies require the release of large number of male mosquitoes into field populations, whether they are based on the use of sterile males (sterile insect technique, SIT) or on introducing genetic traits conferring refractoriness to disease transmission (population replacement). However, the current absence of high-throughput techniques for sorting different mosquito populations impairs the application of these control measures. METHODS: A method was developed to generate large mosquito populations of the desired sex and genotype. This method combines flow cytometry and the use of Anopheles gambiae transgenic lines that differentially express fluorescent markers in males and females. RESULTS: Fluorescence-assisted sorting allowed single-step isolation of homozygous transgenic mosquitoes from a mixed population. This method was also used to select wild-type males only with high efficiency and accuracy, a highly desirable tool for genetic control strategies where the release of transgenic individuals may be problematic. Importantly, sorted males showed normal mating ability compared to their unsorted brothers. CONCLUSIONS: The developed method will greatly facilitate both laboratory studies of mosquito vectorial capacity requiring high-throughput approaches and future field interventions in the fight against infectious disease vectors.},

abstract = {When embryonic stem cells (ESCs) differentiate, they must both silence the ESC self-renewal program and activate new tissue-specific programs. In the absence of DGCR8 (Dgcr8(-/-)), a protein required for microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, mouse ESCs are unable to silence self-renewal. Here we show that the introduction of let-7 miRNAs-a family of miRNAs highly expressed in somatic cells-can suppress self-renewal in Dgcr8(-/-) but not wild-type ESCs. Introduction of ESC cell cycle regulating (ESCC) miRNAs into the Dgcr8(-/-) ESCs blocks the capacity of let-7 to suppress self-renewal. Profiling and bioinformatic analyses show that let-7 inhibits whereas ESCC miRNAs indirectly activate numerous self-renewal genes. Furthermore, inhibition of the let-7 family promotes de-differentiation of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells. Together, these findings show how the ESCC and let-7 miRNAs act through common pathways to alternatively stabilize the self-renewing versus differentiated cell fates.},

@article{Meyer2010,
abstract = {In spite of the global medical and veterinary importance of Ixodid ticks, relatively little is known about their genome organization. To address this, we developed the first fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based chromosome markers in the Lyme disease vector, Ixodes scapularis. Shotgun genomic DNA (gDNA) sequences were used to identify three major tandem repeat families which were localized to specific heterochromatic regions of I. scapularis chromosomes prepared from the mitotic cell line ISE18. Together, these repeats were estimated to contribute approximately 159 Mb (8\%) of the 2.1 Gb (haploid) I. scapularis genome. The relative arrangement of each tandem repeat family and the nucleolar organizing regions was determined by rehybridization to individual chromosome spreads, which was useful to distinguish different chromosomes in the ISE18 karyotype. Long stretches (>20 kb) of tandem repeat-containing gDNA were resistant to digestion by the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII and localized to the presumed peri-centromeric regions of the chromosomes. A telomeric probe based on the arthropod-conserved (TTAGG)(n) tandemly repetitive motif was localized to the termini of each I. scapularis chromosome. Localization of these markers produced the first link between DNA sequences and major structural features of I. scapularis chromosomes and thereby provided the framework for a FISH-based physical map.},

abstract = {The data needed to develop analytical models of trypanosomiasis transmission have become available only recently. By making some simplifying assumptions, models of the dynamics of the disease in vector, cattle and wild mammal populations can be constructed in order to determine criteria for successful disease control by mass and targetted chemotherapy, and by vector control. The heterogeneity in transmission due to tsetse fly feeding preferences and the variability of immunological characteristics among the vertebrate hosts account for differences in prevalence of Trypanosoma vivax and T. congolense, and also lead to an increase in the basic reproductive rates of the parasites and a corresponding decrease in the vector population density threshold for disease eradication or persistence. The long life-span of the vectors relative to the duration of the parasites' developmental period lead to high infection rates in the vector and high values of R0. The efficacy of chemotherapeutic regimes depends on the relationship between treatment rate and the duration of prophylaxis conferred by the drugs used. The model's predictions of the effects of vector control are shown to be in broad agreement with published field data for Mkwaja Ranch, Tanzania. Vector control programmes are frequently blighted by reinvasion, and the implications of this are discussed in terms of a model for fly immigration. With immigration of vectors, the disease is always endemic, though the infection rate in the fly population is modified by the effect of differential mortalities inside and outside the controlled area on cohorts of incubating flies. Sensitivity analysis of the model, using Monte-Carlo methods, enables an assessment of the relative importance of the parameters to be made. The results emphasize the need for studies of the wild animal reservoir to be carried out alongside entomological surveys. The relative accuracy with which field measurements need to be made in order to minimize the uncertainty in predictions of trypanosomiasis prevalence is discussed.},

abstract = {In the last decade there have been marked reductions in malaria incidence in sub-Saharan Africa. Sustaining these reductions will rely upon insecticides to control the mosquito malaria vectors. We report that in the primary African malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, a single enzyme, CYP6M2, confers resistance to two classes of insecticide. This is unique evidence in a disease vector of cross-resistance associated with a single metabolic gene that simultaneously reduces the efficacy of two of the four classes of insecticide routinely used for malaria control. The gene-expression profile of a highly DDT-resistant population of A. gambiae s.s. from Ghana was characterized using a unique whole-genome microarray. A number of genes were significantly overexpressed compared with two susceptible West African colonies, including genes from metabolic families previously linked to insecticide resistance. One of the most significantly overexpressed probe groups (false-discovery rate-adjusted P < 0.0001) belonged to the cytochrome P450 gene CYP6M2. This gene is associated with pyrethroid resistance in wild A. gambiae s.s. populations) and can metabolize both type I and type II pyrethroids in recombinant protein assays. Using in vitro assays we show that recombinant CYP6M2 is also capable of metabolizing the organochlorine insecticide DDT in the presence of solubilizing factor sodium cholate.},

@article{Mollahosseini2012,
abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Studies on malaria vector ecology and development/evaluation of vector control strategies often require measures of mosquito life history traits. Assessing the fecundity of malaria vectors can be carried out by counting eggs laid by Anopheles females. However, manually counting the eggs is time consuming, tedious, and error prone. METHODS: In this paper we present a newly developed software for high precision automatic egg counting. The software written in the Java programming language proposes a user-friendly interface and a complete online manual. It allows the inspection of results by the operator and includes proper tools for manual corrections. The user can in fact correct any details on the acquired results by a mouse click. Time saving is significant and errors due to loss of concentration are avoided. RESULTS: The software was tested over 16 randomly chosen images from 2 different experiments. The results show that the proposed automatic method produces results that are close to the ground truth. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed approaches demonstrated a very high level of robustness. The adoption of the proposed software package will save many hours of labor to the bench scientist. The software needs no particular configuration and is freely available for download on: http://w3.ualg.pt/\~{}hshah/eggcounter/.},

@article{Niida2010,
abstract = {Decoding transcriptional programs governing transcriptomic diversity across human multiple tissues is a major challenge in bioinformatics. To address this problem, a number of computational methods have focused on cis-regulatory codes driving overexpression or underexpression in a single tissue as compared to others. On the other hand, we recently proposed a different approach to mine cis-regulatory codes: starting from gene sets sharing common cis-regulatory motifs, the method screens for expression modules based on expression coherence. However, both approaches seem to be insufficient to capture transcriptional programs that control gene expression in a subset of all samples. Especially, this limitation would be serious when analyzing multiple tissue data. To overcome this limitation, we developed a new module discovery method termed BEEM (Biclusering-based Extraction of Expression Modules) in order to discover expression modules that are functional in a subset of tissues. We showed that, when applied to expression profiles of human multiple tissues, BEEM finds expression modules missed by two existing approaches that are based on the coherent expression and the single tissue-specific differential expression. From the BEEM results, we obtained new insights into transcriptional programs controlling transcriptomic diversity across various types of tissues. This study introduces BEEM as a powerful tool for decoding regulatory programs from a compendium of gene expression profiles.},

abstract = {Over the past five years, large-scale sequencing has been revolutionized by the development of several so-called next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. These have drastically increased the number of bases obtained per sequencing run while at the same time decreasing the costs per base. Compared to Sanger sequencing, NGS technologies yield shorter read lengths; however, despite this drawback, they have greatly facilitated genome sequencing, first for prokaryotic genomes and within the last year also for eukaryotic ones. This advance was possible due to a concomitant development of software that allows the de novo assembly of draft genomes from large numbers of short reads. In addition, NGS can be used for metagenomics studies as well as for the detection of sequence variations within individual genomes, e.g. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions/deletions (indels) or structural variants. Furthermore, NGS technologies have quickly been adopted for other high-throughput studies that were previously performed mostly by hybridization-based methods like microarrays. This includes the use of NGS for transcriptomics (RNA-seq) or the genome-wide analysis of DNA/protein interactions (ChIP-seq). This review provides an overview of NGS technologies that are currently available and the bioinformatics analyses that are necessary to obtain information from the flood of sequencing data as well as applications of NGS to address biological questions in eukaryotic microorganisms.},

They bind to thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), TRalpha and TRbeta, which belong to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. These receptors also bind to enhancer elements in the promoters of target genes, and can regulate both positive and negative transcription. Recent emerging evidence has characterized some of the molecular mechanisms by which THs regulate transcription as co-repressors, and co-activators have been identified and their effects on histone acetylation examined. THs also have rapid effects that do not require transcription. These can occur via TRs or other cellular proteins, and typically occur outside the nucleus. It appears that THs regulate multiple cellular functions using a diverse array of receptors and signaling systems. TR isoform- or pathway-specific drugs might provide the therapeutic benefits of TH action such as decreasing obesity or lowering cholesterol levels without some of the side effects of hyperthyroidism.},

abstract = {Analogous to observations in RNA viruses such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus, genetic variation associated with intra-host dengue virus (DENV) populations has been postulated to influence viral fitness and disease pathogenesis. Previous attempts to investigate intra-host genetic variation in DENV characterized only a handful of viral genes or limited number of full-length genomes. We developed a whole-genome amplification approach coupled with deep sequencing to capture intra-host diversity across the entire coding region of DENV-2. Using this approach, we sequenced DENV-2 genomes from the serum of 22 Nicaraguan individuals with secondary DENV infection and captured ∼75\% of the DENV genome in each sample (range 40-98\%). We identified and quantified variants using a highly sensitive and specific method, and determined that the extent of diversity was considerably lower than previous estimates. Significant differences in intra-host diversity were detected between genes and also between antigenically distinct domains of the Envelope gene. Interestingly, a strong association was discerned between the extent of intra-host diversity in a handful of genes and viral clade identity. Additionally, the abundance of viral variants within a host, as well as the impact of viral mutations on amino acid encoding and predicted protein function, determined whether intra-host variants were observed at the inter-host level in circulating Nicaraguan DENV-2 populations, strongly suggestive of purifying selection across transmission events. Our data illustrate the value of high-coverage genome-wide analysis of intra-host diversity for high-resolution mapping of the relationship between intra-host diversity and clinical, epidemiological and virological parameters of viral infection.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Recent attempts to account for multiple testing in the analysis of microarray data have focused on controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). However, rigorous control of the FDR at a preselected level is often impractical. Consequently, it has been suggested to use the q-value as an estimate of the proportion of false discoveries among a set of significant findings. However, such an interpretation of the q-value may be unwarranted considering that the q-value is based on an unstable estimator of the positive FDR (pFDR). Another method proposes estimating the FDR by modeling p-values as arising from a beta-uniform mixture (BUM) distribution. Unfortunately, the BUM approach is reliable only in settings where the assumed model accurately represents the actual distribution of p-values. METHODS: A method called the spacings LOESS histogram (SPLOSH) is proposed for estimating the conditional FDR (cFDR), the expected proportion of false positives conditioned on having k 'significant' findings. SPLOSH is designed to be more stable than the q-value and applicable in a wider variety of settings than BUM. RESULTS: In a simulation study and data analysis example, SPLOSH exhibits the desired characteristics relative to the q-value and BUM.

Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the "alphabet" used to describe those systems.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Current methodologies for the selection of putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) rely on various assumptions such as over-representation of motifs occurring on gene promoters, and the use of motif descriptions such as consensus or position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs). In order to avoid bias introduced by such assumptions, we apply an unsupervised motif extraction (MEX) algorithm to sequences of promoters. The extracted motifs are assessed for their likely cis-regulatory function by calculating the expression coherence (EC) of the corresponding genes, across a set of biological conditions. RESULTS: Applying MEX to all Saccharomyces cerevisiae promoters, followed by EC analysis across 40 biological conditions, we obtained a high percentage of putative cis-regulatory motifs. We clustered motifs that obtained highly significant EC scores, based on both their sequence similarity and similarity in the biological conditions these motifs appear to regulate. We describe 20 clusters, some of which regroup known TFBS. The clusters display different mRNA expression profiles, correlated with typical changes in the nucleotide composition of their relevant motifs. In several cases, a variation of a single nucleotide is shown to lead to distinct differences in expression patterns. These results are confronted with additional information, such as binding of transcription factors to groups of genes. Detailed analysis is presented for clusters related to MCB/SCB, STRE and PAC. In the first two cases, we provide evidence for different binding mechanisms of different clusters of motifs. For PAC-related motifs we uncover a new cluster that has so far been overshadowed by the stronger effects of known PAC motifs.

abstract = {The ability of many viruses to manipulate the host antiviral immune response often results in complex host-pathogen interactions. In order to study the interaction of dengue virus (DENV) with the Aedes aegypti immune response, we have characterized the DENV infection-responsive transcriptome of the immune-competent A. aegypti cell line Aag2. As in mosquitoes, DENV infection transcriptionally activated the cell line Toll pathway and a variety of cellular physiological systems. Most notably, however, DENV infection down-regulated the expression levels of numerous immune signaling molecules and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Functional assays showed that transcriptional induction of AMPs from the Toll and IMD pathways in response to bacterial challenge is impaired in DENV-infected cells. In addition, Escherichia coli, a gram-negative bacteria species, grew better when co-cultured with DENV-infected cells than with uninfected cells, suggesting a decreased production of AMPs from the IMD pathway in virus-infected cells. Pre-stimulation of the cell line with gram-positive bacteria prior to DENV infection had no effect on DENV titers, while pre-stimulation with gram-negative bacteria resulted in an increase in DENV titers. These results indicate that DENV is capable of actively suppressing immune responses in the cells it infects, a phenomenon that may have important consequences for virus transmission and insect physiology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in a variety of organisms, including insects, vertebrates, and plants. miRNAs play important roles in cell development and differentiation as well as in the cellular response to stress and infection. To date, there are limited reports of miRNA identification in mosquitoes, insects that act as essential vectors for the transmission of many human pathogens, including flaviviruses. West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus, members of the Flaviviridae family, are primarily transmitted by Aedes and Culex mosquitoes. Using high-throughput deep sequencing, we examined the miRNA repertoire in Ae. albopictus cells and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. RESULTS: We identified a total of 65 miRNAs in the Ae. albopictus C7/10 cell line and 77 miRNAs in Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, the majority of which are conserved in other insects such as Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae. The most highly expressed miRNA in both mosquito species was miR-184, a miRNA conserved from insects to vertebrates. Several previously reported Anopheles miRNAs, including miR-1890 and miR-1891, were also found in Culex and Aedes, and appear to be restricted to mosquitoes. We identified seven novel miRNAs, arising from nine different precursors, in C7/10 cells and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, two of which have predicted orthologs in An. gambiae. Several of these novel miRNAs reside within a \~{}350 nt long cluster present in both Aedes and Culex. miRNA expression was confirmed by primer extension analysis. To determine whether flavivirus infection affects miRNA expression, we infected female Culex mosquitoes with WNV. Two miRNAs, miR-92 and miR-989, showed significant changes in expression levels following WNV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Aedes and Culex mosquitoes are important flavivirus vectors. Recent advances in both mosquito genomics and high-throughput sequencing technologies enabled us to interrogate the miRNA profile in these two species. Here, we provide evidence for over 60 conserved and seven novel mosquito miRNAs, expanding upon our current understanding of insect miRNAs. Undoubtedly, some of the miRNAs identified will have roles not only in mosquito development, but also in mediating viral infection in the mosquito host.},

However, the enormous complexity of folding landscapes of large macromolecules raises the question of whether there is in fact a unique global minimum corresponding to a unique native conformation or whether there are deep local minima corresponding to alternative active conformations. The folding of many proteins is well described by two-state models, leading to highly simplified representations of protein folding landscapes with a single native conformation. Nevertheless, accumulating experimental evidence suggests a more complex topology of folding landscapes with multiple active conformations that can take seconds or longer to interconvert. Here we demonstrate, using single-molecule experiments, that an RNA enzyme folds into multiple distinct native states that interconvert on a timescale much longer than that of catalysis. These data demonstrate that severe ruggedness of RNA folding landscapes extends into conformational space occupied by native conformations.},

@article{Specchia2010,
abstract = {The canalization concept describes the resistance of a developmental process to phenotypic variation, regardless of genetic and environmental perturbations, owing to the existence of buffering mechanisms. Severe perturbations, which overcome such buffering mechanisms, produce altered phenotypes that can be heritable and can themselves be canalized by a genetic assimilation process. An important implication of this concept is that the buffering mechanism could be genetically controlled. Recent studies on Hsp90, a protein involved in several cellular processes and development pathways, indicate that it is a possible molecular mechanism for canalization and genetic assimilation. In both flies and plants, mutations in the Hsp90-encoding gene induce a wide range of phenotypic abnormalities, which have been interpreted as an increased sensitivity of different developmental pathways to hidden genetic variability. Thus, Hsp90 chaperone machinery may be an evolutionarily conserved buffering mechanism of phenotypic variance, which provides the genetic material for natural selection. Here we offer an additional, perhaps alternative, explanation for proposals of a concrete mechanism underlying canalization. We show that, in Drosophila, functional alterations of Hsp90 affect the Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA; a class of germ-line-specific small RNAs) silencing mechanism leading to transposon activation and the induction of morphological mutants. This indicates that Hsp90 mutations can generate new variation by transposon-mediated 'canonical' mutagenesis.},

@article{Stover2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Today it is common to apply multiple potentially conflicting data sources to a given phylogenetic problem. At the same time, several different inference techniques are routinely employed instead of relying on just one. In view of both trends it is becoming increasingly important to be able to efficiently compare different sets of statistical values supporting (or conflicting with) the nodes of a given tree topology, and merging this into a meaningful representation. A tree editor supporting this should also allow for flexible editing operations and be able to produce ready-to-publish figures. RESULTS: We developed TreeGraph 2, a GUI-based graphical editor for phylogenetic trees (available from http://treegraph.bioinfweb.info). It allows automatically combining information from different phylogenetic analyses of a given dataset (or from different subsets of the dataset), and helps to identify and graphically present incongruences. The program features versatile editing and formatting options, such as automatically setting line widths or colors according to the value of any of the unlimited number of variables that can be assigned to each node or branch. These node/branch data can be imported from spread sheets or other trees, be calculated from each other by specified mathematical expressions, filtered, copied from and to other internal variables, be kept invisible or set visible and then be freely formatted (individually or across the whole tree). Beyond typical editing operations such as tree rerooting and ladderizing or moving and collapsing of nodes, whole clades can be copied from other files and be inserted (along with all node/branch data and legends), but can also be manually added and, thus, whole trees can quickly be manually constructed de novo. TreeGraph 2 outputs various graphic formats such as SVG, PDF, or PNG, useful for tree figures in both publications and presentations. CONCLUSION: TreeGraph 2 is a user-friendly, fully documented application to produce ready-to-publish trees. It can display any number of annotations in several ways, and permits easily importing and combining them. Additionally, a great number of editing- and formatting-operations is available.},

Vitellogenesis is regulated by the 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) regulatory hierarchy, in which the Ets-domain protein E74 is a key transcriptional regulator. The mosquito AaE74 gene encodes two isoforms-AaE74A and AaE74B. Both AaE74 isoforms are 20E-inducible early gene products. AaE74B reaches its maximal expression at 10(-7)M of 20E, while AaE74A requires 10(-6)M of 20E, a concentration at which the YPP genes reach their maximal induction level. In transfection assay, AaE74B is capable of activating a reporter construct containing E74-response elements, while expression of AaE74A has no effect on the basal levels of the reporter. The AaE74B binding activity is present in the fat body nuclei only during active vitellogenesis. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that AaE74B isoform plays the role of a transcriptional activator during vitellogenesis.},

Identifying the environmental and genetic causes of variation in mosquito competence for arboviruses is one of the great challenges in public health. Progress identifying genetic (nature) and environmental (nurture) factors influencing mosquito competence for arboviruses is reviewed. There is great complexity in the various traits that comprise mosquito competence. The complex interactions between environmental and genetic factors controlling these traits and the factors shaping variation in Nature are largely unknown. The norms of reaction of specific genes influencing competence, their distributions in natural populations and the effects of genetic polymorphism on phenotypic variation need to be determined. Mechanisms influencing competence are not likely due to natural selection because of the direct effects of the arbovirus on mosquito fitness. More likely the traits for mosquito competence for arboviruses are the effects of adaptations for other functions of these competence mechanisms. Determining these other functions is essential to understand the evolution and distributions of competence for arboviruses. This information is needed to assess risk from mosquito-borne disease, predict new mosquito-arbovirus systems, and provide novel strategies to mitigate mosquito-borne arbovirus transmission.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: , the yellow fever mosquito, is an efficient vector of arboviruses and a convenient model system for laboratory research. Extensive linkage mapping of morphological and molecular markers localized a number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to the mosquito's ability to transmit various pathogens. However, linking the QTLs to chromosomes and genomic sequences has been challenging because of the poor quality of polytene chromosomes and the highly fragmented genome assembly for this species. METHODOLOGYPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Based on the approach developed in our previous study, we constructed idiograms for mitotic chromosomes of based on their banding patterns at early metaphase. These idiograms represent the first cytogenetic map developed for mitotic chromosomes of . One hundred bacterial artificial chromosome clones carrying major genetic markers were hybridized to the chromosomes using fluorescent hybridization. As a result, QTLs related to the transmission of the filarioid nematode , the avian malaria parasite , and the dengue virus, as well as sex determination locus and 183 Mbp of genomic sequences were anchored to the exact positions on chromosomes. A linear regression analysis demonstrated a good correlation between positions of the markers on the physical and linkage maps. As a result of the recombination rate variation along the chromosomes, 12 QTLs on the linkage map were combined into five major clusters of QTLs on the chromosome map. CONCLUSION: This study developed an integrated linkage, chromosome, and genome map-iMap-for the yellow fever mosquito. Our discovery of the localization of multiple QTLs in a few major chromosome clusters suggests a possibility that the transmission of various pathogens is controlled by the same genomic loci.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is known that transcription factors frequently act together to regulate gene expression in eukaryotes. In this paper we describe a computational analysis of transcription factor site dependencies in human, mouse and rat genomes. RESULTS: Our approach for quantifying tendencies of transcription factor binding sites to co-occur is based on a binding site scoring function which incorporates dependencies between positions, the use of information about the structural class of each transcription factor (major/minor groove binder), and also considered the possible implications of varying GC content of the sequences. Significant tendencies (dependencies) have been detected by non-parametric statistical methodology (permutation tests). Evaluation of obtained results has been performed in several ways: reports from literature (many of the significant dependencies between transcription factors have previously been confirmed experimentally); dependencies between transcription factors are not biased due to similarities in their DNA-binding sites; the number of dependent transcription factors that belong to the same functional and structural class is significantly higher than would be expected by chance; supporting evidence from GO clustering of targeting genes. Based on dependencies between two transcription factor binding sites (second-order dependencies), it is possible to construct higher-order dependencies (networks). Moreover results about transcription factor binding sites dependencies can be used for prediction of groups of dependent transcription factors on a given promoter sequence. Our results, as well as a scanning tool for predicting groups of dependent transcription factors binding sites are available on the Internet. CONCLUSION: We show that the computational analysis of transcription factor site dependencies is a valuable complement to experimental approaches for discovering transcription regulatory interactions and networks. Scanning promoter sequences with dependent groups of transcription factor binding sites improve the quality of transcription factor predictions.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: A new protocol for sequencing the messenger RNA in a cell, known as RNA-Seq, generates millions of short sequence fragments in a single run. These fragments, or 'reads', can be used to measure levels of gene expression and to identify novel splice variants of genes. However, current software for aligning RNA-Seq data to a genome relies on known splice junctions and cannot identify novel ones. TopHat is an efficient read-mapping algorithm designed to align reads from an RNA-Seq experiment to a reference genome without relying on known splice sites. RESULTS: We mapped the RNA-Seq reads from a recent mammalian RNA-Seq experiment and recovered more than 72\% of the splice junctions reported by the annotation-based software from that study, along with nearly 20,000 previously unreported junctions. The TopHat pipeline is much faster than previous systems, mapping nearly 2.2 million reads per CPU hour, which is sufficient to process an entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day on a standard desktop computer. We describe several challenges unique to ab initio splice site discovery from RNA-Seq reads that will require further algorithm development. AVAILABILITY: TopHat is free, open-source software available from http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Conservation of function can be accompanied by obvious similarity of homologous sequences which may persist for billions of years (Iyer et al. 2004). However, presumably homologous segments of non-coding DNA can also retain their ancestral function even after their sequences diverge beyond recognition (Fisher et al. 2006). To investigate this phenomenon at the genomic scale, we studied homologous introns in a quartet of insect species, and in a quartet of vertebrate species. Each quartet consisted of two pairs of moderately distant genomes, with a much larger evolutionary distance between the pairs. In both quartets, we found that introns that carry a regulatory segment or a conserved segment in the first pair tend to carry a conserved segment in the second pair, even though no similarity of these segments could be detected between the two pairs. Furthermore, introns from one pair that are preserved in the other pair tend to carry a conserved segment within the first pair, and to be longer in the first pair, compared with the introns that were lost between pairs, even though no similarity between pairs could be detected in such preserved introns. These results indicate that selective constraint, presumably caused by conservation of the ancestral function, often persists even after the homologous DNA segments become unalignable.},

abstract = {Metazoan transcription regulation occurs through the concerted action of multiple transcription factors that bind co-operatively to cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). The annotation of these key regulators of transcription is lagging far behind the annotation of the transcriptome itself. Here, we give an overview of existing computational methods to detect these CRMs in metazoan genomes. We subdivide these methods into three classes: CRM scanners screen sequences for CRMs based on predefined models that often consist of multiple position weight matrices (PWMs). CRM builders construct models of similar CRMs controlling a set of co-regulated or co-expressed genes. CRM genome screeners screen sequences or complete genomes for CRMs as homotypic or heterotypic clusters of binding sites for any combination of transcription factors. We believe that CRM scanners are currently the most advanced methods, although their applicability is limited. Finally, we argue that CRM builders that make use of PWM libraries will benefit greatly from future advances and will prove to be most instrumental for the annotation of regulatory regions in metazoan genomes.},

@article{Veerla2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of global gene expression profiling is a well established approach to understand biological processes. One of the major goals of these investigations is to identify sets of genes with similar expression patterns. Such gene signatures may be very informative and reveal new aspects of particular biological processes. A logical and systematic next step is to reduce the identified gene signatures to the regulatory components that induce the relevant gene expression changes. A central issue in this context is to identify transcription factors, or transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), likely to be of importance for the expression of the gene signatures. RESULTS: We develop a strategy that efficiently produces TFBS/promoter databases based on user-defined criteria. The resulting databases constitute all genes in the Santa Cruz database and the positions for all TFBS provided by the user as position weight matrices. These databases are then used for two purposes, to identify significant TFBS in the promoters in sets of genes and to identify clusters of co-occurring TFBS. We use two criteria for significance, significantly enriched TFBS in terms of total number of binding sites for the promoters, and significantly present TFBS in terms of the fraction of promoters with binding sites. Significant TFBS are identified by a re-sampling procedure in which the query gene set is compared with typically 10(5) gene lists of similar size randomly drawn from the TFBS/promoter database. We apply this strategy to a large number of published ChIP-Chip data sets and show that the proposed approach faithfully reproduces ChIP-Chip results. The strategy also identifies relevant TFBS when analyzing gene signatures obtained from the MSigDB database. In addition, we show that several TFBS are highly correlated and that co-occurring TFBS define functionally related sets of genes. CONCLUSIONS: The presented approach of promoter analysis faithfully reproduces the results from several ChIP-Chip and MigDB derived gene sets and hence may prove to be an important method in the analysis of gene signatures obtained through ChIP-Chip or global gene expression experiments. We show that TFBS are organized in clusters of co-occurring TFBS that together define highly coherent sets of genes.},

abstract = {Flies are one of four superradiations of insects (along with beetles, wasps, and moths) that account for the majority of animal life on Earth. Diptera includes species known for their ubiquity (Musca domestica house fly), their role as pests (Anopheles gambiae malaria mosquito), and their value as model organisms across the biological sciences (Drosophila melanogaster). A resolved phylogeny for flies provides a framework for genomic, developmental, and evolutionary studies by facilitating comparisons across model organisms, yet recent research has suggested that fly relationships have been obscured by multiple episodes of rapid diversification. We provide a phylogenomic estimate of fly relationships based on molecules and morphology from 149 of 157 families, including 30 kb from 14 nuclear loci and complete mitochondrial genomes combined with 371 morphological characters. Multiple analyses show support for traditional groups (Brachycera, Cyclorrhapha, and Schizophora) and corroborate contentious findings, such as the anomalous Deuterophlebiidae as the sister group to all remaining Diptera. Our findings reveal that the closest relatives of the Drosophilidae are highly modified parasites (including the wingless Braulidae) of bees and other insects. Furthermore, we use micro-RNAs to resolve a node with implications for the evolution of embryonic development in Diptera. We demonstrate that flies experienced three episodes of rapid radiation--lower Diptera (220 Ma), lower Brachycera (180 Ma), and Schizophora (65 Ma)--and a number of life history transitions to hematophagy, phytophagy, and parasitism in the history of fly evolution over 260 million y.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Finding functional regulatory elements in DNA sequences is a very important problem in computational biology and providing a reliable algorithm for this task would be a major step towards understanding regulatory mechanisms on genome-wide scale. Major obstacles in this respect are that the fact that the amount of non-coding DNA is vast, and that the methods for predicting functional transcription factor binding sites tend to produce results with a high percentage of false positives. This makes the problem of finding regions significantly enriched in binding sites difficult. RESULTS: We develop a novel method for predicting regulatory regions in DNA sequences, which is designed to exploit the evolutionary conservation of regulatory elements between species without assuming that the order of motifs is preserved across species. We have implemented our method and tested its predictive abilities on various datasets from different organisms. CONCLUSION: We show that our approach enables us to find a majority of the known CRMs using only sequence information from different species together with currently publicly available motif data. Also, our method is robust enough to perform well in predicting CRMs, despite differences in tissue specificity and even across species, provided that the evolutionary distances between compared species do not change substantially. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is polynomial, and the observed running times show that it may be readily applied.},

abstract = {The ability to quantitatively survey the global behavior of transcriptomes has been a key milestone in the field of systems biology, enabled by the advent of DNA microarrays. While this approach has literally transformed our vision and approach to cellular physiology, microarray technology has always been limited by the requirement to decide, a priori, what regions of the genome to examine. While very high density tiling arrays have reduced this limitation for simpler organisms, it remains an obstacle for larger, more complex, eukaryotic genomes. The recent development of "next-generation" massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technologies by companies such as Roche (454 GS FLX), Illumina (Genome Analyzer II), and ABI (AB SOLiD) has completely transformed the way in which quantitative transcriptomics can be done. These new technologies have reduced both the cost-per-reaction and time required by orders of magnitude, making the use of sequencing a cost-effective option for many experimental approaches. One such method that has recently been developed uses MPS technology to directly survey the RNA content of cells, without requiring any of the traditional cloning associated with EST sequencing. This approach, called "RNA-seq", can generate quantitative expression scores that are comparable to microarrays, with the added benefit that the entire transcriptome is surveyed without the requirement of a priori knowledge of transcribed regions. The important advantage of this technique is that not only can quantitative expression measures be made, but transcript structures including alternatively spliced transcript isoforms, can also be identified. This article discusses the experimental approach for both sample preparation and data analysis for the technique of RNA-seq.},

abstract = {Insulators are multiprotein-DNA complexes thought to affect gene expression by mediating inter- and intrachromosomal interactions. Drosophila insulators contain specific DNA-binding proteins plus common components, such as CP190, that facilitate these interactions. Here, we examine changes in the distribution of Drosophila insulator proteins during the heat-shock and ecdysone responses. We find that CP190 recruitment to insulator sites is the main regulatable step in controlling insulator function during heat shock. In contrast, both CP190 and DNA-binding protein recruitment are regulated during the ecdysone response. CP190 is necessary to stabilize specific chromatin loops and for proper activation of transcription of genes regulated by this hormone. These findings suggest that cells may regulate recruitment of insulator proteins to DNA to activate insulator activity at specific sites and create distinct patterns of nuclear organization that are necessary to achieve proper gene expression in response to different stimuli.},

abstract = {Recently a state-space model with time delays for inferring gene regulatory networks was proposed. It was assumed that each regulation between two internal state variables had multiple time delays. This assumption caused underestimation of the model with many current gene expression datasets. In biological reality, one regulatory relationship may have just a single time delay, and not multiple time delays. This study employs Boolean variables to capture the existence of the time-delayed regulatory relationships in gene regulatory networks in terms of the state-space model. As the solution space of time delayed relationships is too large for an exhaustive search, a genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to determine the optimal Boolean variables (the optimal time-delayed regulatory relationships). Coupled with the proposed GA, Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and probabilistic principle component analysis (PPCA) are employed to infer gene regulatory networks with time delays. Computational experiments are performed on two real gene expression datasets. The results show that the GA is effective at finding time-delayed regulatory relationships. Moreover, the inferred gene regulatory networks with time delays from the datasets improve the prediction accuracy and possess more of the expected properties of a real network, compared to a gene regulatory network without time delays.},

abstract = {Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a neurotropic mosquito-borne flavivirus, causes acute viral encephalitis and neurologic disease with a high fatality rate in humans and a range of animals. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a powerful antiviral agent able to inhibit JEV replication. However, the high rate of genetic variability between JEV strains (of four confirmed genotypes, genotypes I, II, III and IV) hampers the broad-spectrum application of siRNAs, and mutations within the targeted sequences could facilitate JEV escape from RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated antiviral therapy. To improve the broad-spectrum application of siRNAs and prevent the generation of escape mutants, multiple siRNAs targeting conserved viral sequences need to be combined. In this study, using a siRNA expression vector based on the miR-155 backbone and promoted by RNA polymerase II, we initially identified nine siRNAs targeting highly conserved regions of seven JEV genes among strains of the four genotypes of JEV to effectively block the replication of the JEV vaccine strain SA14-14-2. Then, we constructed single microRNA-like polycistrons to simultaneously express these effective siRNAs under a single RNA polymerase II promoter. Finally, these single siRNAs or multiple siRNAs from the microRNA-like polycistrons showed effective anti-virus activity in genotype I and genotype III JEV wild type strains, which are the predominant genotypes of JEV in mainland China. The anti-JEV effect of these microRNA-like polycistrons was also predicted in other genotypes of JEV (genotypes II and IV), The inhibitory efficacy indicated that siRNAs×9 could theoretically inhibit the replication of JEV genotypes II and IV.},

Here, we present a comparative analysis of the human, mouse, rat and dog genomes to create a systematic catalogue of common regulatory motifs in promoters and 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs). The promoter analysis yields 174 candidate motifs, including most previously known transcription-factor binding sites and 105 new motifs. The 3'-UTR analysis yields 106 motifs likely to be involved in post-transcriptional regulation. Nearly one-half are associated with microRNAs (miRNAs), leading to the discovery of many new miRNA genes and their likely target genes. Our results suggest that previous estimates of the number of human miRNA genes were low, and that miRNAs regulate at least 20\% of human genes. The overall results provide a systematic view of gene regulation in the human, which will be refined as additional mammalian genomes become available.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs can be accurately represented by position frequency matrices (PFM) or other equivalent forms. We often need to compare TFBS motifs using their PFMs in order to search for similar motifs in a motif database, or cluster motifs according to their binding preference. The majority of current methods for motif comparison involve a similarity metric for column-to-column comparison and a method to find the optimal position alignment between the two compared motifs. In some applications, alignment-free methods might be preferred; however, few such methods with high accuracy have been described. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we describe a novel alignment-free method for quantifying the similarity of motifs using their PFMs by converting PFMs into k-mer vectors. The motifs could then be compared by measuring the similarity among their corresponding k-mer vectors. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that our method in general achieves similar performance or outperforms the existing methods for clustering motifs according to their binding preference and identifying similar motifs of transcription factors of the same family.},

Here, we test the hypothesis that the right temporoparietal junction (RTPJ), an area involved in mental state reasoning, is necessary for making moral judgments. In two experiments, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to disrupt neural activity in the RTPJ transiently before moral judgment (experiment 1, offline stimulation) and during moral judgment (experiment 2, online stimulation). In both experiments, TMS to the RTPJ led participants to rely less on the actor's mental states. A particularly striking effect occurred for attempted harms (e.g., actors who intended but failed to do harm): Relative to TMS to a control site, TMS to the RTPJ caused participants to judge attempted harms as less morally forbidden and more morally permissible. Thus, interfering with activity in the RTPJ disrupts the capacity to use mental states in moral judgment, especially in the case of attempted harms.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormone is essential for normal development, differentiation, and metabolic balance. Thyroid hormone action is mediated by multiple thyroid hormone receptor isoforms derived from two distinct genes. The thyroid hormone receptors belong to a nuclear receptor superfamily that also includes receptors for other small lipophilic hormones. Thyroid hormone receptors function by binding to specific thyroid hormone-responsive sequences in promoters of target genes and by regulating transcription. Thyroid hormone receptors often form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors. Heterodimerization is regulated through distinct mechanisms that together determine the specificity and flexibility of the sequence recognition. Amino-terminal regions appear to modulate thyroid hormone receptor function in an isoform-dependent manner. Unliganded thyroid hormone receptor represses transcription through recruitment of a corepressor complex, which also includes Sin3A and histone deacetylase. Ligand binding alters the conformation of the thyroid hormone receptor in such a way as to release the corepressor complex and recruit a coactivator complex that includes multiple histone acetyltransferases, including a steroid receptor family coactivator, p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor (PCAF), and CREB binding protein (CBP). The existence of histone-modifying activities in the transcriptional regulatory complexes indicates an important role of chromatin structure. Stoichiometric, structural, and sequence-specific rules for coregulator interaction are beginning to be understood, as are aspects of the tissue specificity of hormone action. Moreover, knockout studies suggest that the products of two thyroid hormone receptor genes mediate distinct functions in vivo. The increased understanding of the structure and function of thyroid hormone receptors and their interacting proteins has markedly clarified the molecular mechanisms of thyroid hormone action.},

abstract = {Many aspects of reproductive maturation in newly emerged adult female mosquitoes are controlled by juvenile hormone (JH). However, the molecular basis of this hormonal regulation remains poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed transcriptome changes in young female adults after topical application of exogenous JH. mRNA levels of 16 and 72 genes were enhanced at 3 h and 12 h after hormone administration, respectively. The observed upregulations can be also induced by the JH analogues, methoprene and pyriproxyfen, but not by farnesol, indicating that these responses are JH-specific. Among the genes activated by JH is the mosquito Kr\"{u}ppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1) gene. Studies in the beetle Tribolium castaneum have indicated that Kr-h1 is transcriptionally activated by JH during metamorphosis and encodes a gene expression regulator acting downstream of the methoprene-tolerant (Met) gene in the JH signaling pathway. We found that the upregulation of AaKr-h1 after eclosion relied on the function of the mosquito Met protein, suggesting that a conserved JH signaling pathway is utilized both in the metamorphosis of T. castaneum and in the adult reproductive maturation of the Aedes aegypti mosquito. This study lays a foundation for a better understanding of the mechanisms of juvenile hormone action.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Hematophagy is a common trait of insect vectors of disease. Extensive genome-wide transcriptional changes occur in mosquitoes after blood meals, and these are related to digestive and reproductive processes, among others. Studies of these changes are expected to reveal molecular targets for novel vector control and pathogen transmission-blocking strategies. The mosquito Aedes aegypti (Diptera, Culicidae), a vector of Dengue viruses, Yellow Fever Virus (YFV) and Chikungunya virus (CV), is the subject of this study to look at genome-wide changes in gene expression following a blood meal. RESULTS: Transcriptional changes that follow a blood meal in Ae. aegypti females were explored using RNA-seq technology. Over 30\% of more than 18,000 investigated transcripts accumulate differentially in mosquitoes at five hours after a blood meal when compared to those fed only on sugar. Forty transcripts accumulate only in blood-fed mosquitoes. The list of regulated transcripts correlates with an enhancement of digestive activity and a suppression of environmental stimuli perception and innate immunity. The alignment of more than 65 million high-quality short reads to the Ae. aegypti reference genome permitted the refinement of the current annotation of transcript boundaries, as well as the discovery of novel transcripts, exons and splicing variants. Cis-regulatory elements (CRE) and cis-regulatory modules (CRM) enriched significantly at the 5'end flanking sequences of blood meal-regulated genes were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first global view of the changes in transcript accumulation elicited by a blood meal in Ae. aegypti females. This information permitted the identification of classes of potentially co-regulated genes and a description of biochemical and physiological events that occur immediately after blood feeding. The data presented here serve as a basis for novel vector control and pathogen transmission-blocking strategies including those in which the vectors are modified genetically to express anti-pathogen effector molecules.},

abstract = {The discovery and mapping of cis-regulatory elements is important for understanding regulation of gene transcription in mosquito vectors of human diseases. Genome sequence data are available for 3 species, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, and Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae), representing 2 subfamilies (Culicinae and Anophelinae) that are estimated to have diverged 145 to 200 million years ago. Comparative genomics tools were used to screen genomic DNA fragments located in the 5'-end flanking regions of orthologous genes. These analyses resulted in the identification of 137 sequences, designated "mosquito motifs," 7 to 9 nucleotides in length, representing 18 families of putative cis-regulatory elements conserved significantly among the 3 species when compared to the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Forty-one of the motifs were implicated previously in experiments as sites for binding transcription factors or functioning in the regulation of mosquito gene expression. Further analyses revealed associations between specific motifs and expression profiles, particularly in those genes that show increased or decreased mRNA abundance in females following a blood meal, and those accumulating transcription products exclusively or preferentially in the midgut, fat bodies, or ovaries. These results validate the methodology and support a relationship between the discovered motifs and the conservation of hematophagy in mosquitoes.},

In mosquitoes, prophenoloxidase has been shown to be involved in refractory mechanisms against malaria parasites. In our study we used Anopheles gambiae, the most important human malaria vector, to characterize the first arthropod prophenoloxidase gene at the genomic level. The complete nucleotide sequence, including the immediate 5' flanking sequence (-855 bp) of the prophenoloxidase 1 gene, was determined. The gene spans 10 kb and is composed of five exons and four introns coding for a 2.5-kb mRNA. In the 5' flanking sequence, we found several putative regulatory motifs, two of which were identified as ecdysteroid regulatory elements. Electrophoretic mobility gel-shift assays and supershift assays demonstrated that the Aedes aegypti ecdysone receptor/Ultraspiracle nuclear receptor complex, and, seemingly, the endogenous Anopheles gambiae nuclear receptor complex, was able to bind one of the ecdysteroid response elements. Furthermore, 20-hydroxyecdysone stimulation was shown to up-regulate the transcription of the prophenoloxidase 1 gene in an A. gambiae cell line.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression in plants and animals. Although their biological importance has become clear, how they recognize and regulate target genes remains less well understood. Here, we systematically evaluate the minimal requirements for functional miRNA-target duplexes in vivo and distinguish classes of target sites with different functional properties. Target sites can be grouped into two broad categories. 5' dominant sites have sufficient complementarity to the miRNA 5' end to function with little or no support from pairing to the miRNA 3' end. Indeed, sites with 3' pairing below the random noise level are functional given a strong 5' end. In contrast, 3' compensatory sites have insufficient 5' pairing and require strong 3' pairing for function. We present examples and genome-wide statistical support to show that both classes of sites are used in biologically relevant genes. We provide evidence that an average miRNA has approximately 100 target sites, indicating that miRNAs regulate a large fraction of protein-coding genes and that miRNA 3' ends are key determinants of target specificity within miRNA families.},

abstract = {Tissue development and function are exquisitely dependent on proper regulation of gene expression, but it remains controversial whether the genomic signals controlling this process are subject to strong selective constraint. While some studies show that highly constrained noncoding regions act to enhance transcription, other studies show that DNA segments with biochemical signatures of regulatory regions, such as occupancy by a transcription factor, are seemingly unconstrained across mammalian evolution. To test the possible correlation of selective constraint with enhancer activity, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation as an approach unbiased by either evolutionary constraint or prior knowledge of regulatory activity to identify DNA segments within a 66-Mb region of mouse chromosome 7 that are occupied by the erythroid transcription factor GATA1. DNA segments bound by GATA1 were identified by hybridization to high-density tiling arrays, validated by quantitative PCR, and tested for gene regulatory activity in erythroid cells. Whereas almost all of the occupied segments contain canonical WGATAR binding site motifs for GATA1, in only 45\% of the cases is the motif deeply preserved (found at the orthologous position in placental mammals or more distant species). However, GATA1-bound segments with high enhancer activity tend to be the ones with an evolutionarily preserved WGATAR motif, and this relationship was confirmed by a loss-of-function assay. Thus, GATA1 binding sites that regulate gene expression during erythroid maturation are under strong selective constraint, while nonconstrained binding may have only a limited or indirect role in regulation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the many ascribed functions of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in vertebrates is insulation of genes via enhancer-blocking. Insulation allows genes to be shielded from "cross-talk" with neighboring regulatory elements. As such, endogenous insulator sequences would be valuable elements to enable stable transgene expression. Recently, CTCF joined Su(Hw), Zw5, BEAF32 and GAGA factor as a protein associated with insulator activity in the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster. To date, no known insulators have been described in mosquitoes. RESULTS: We have identified and characterized putative CTCF homologs in the medically-important mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae. These genes encode polypeptides with eleven C2H2 zinc fingers that show significant similarity to those of vertebrate CTCFs, despite at least 500 million years of divergence. The mosquito CTCFs are constitutively expressed and are upregulated in early embryos and in the ovaries of blood-fed females. We have uncovered significant bioinformatics evidence that CTCF is widespread, at least among Drosophila species. Finally, we show that the An. gambiae CTCF binds two known insulator sequences. CONCLUSION: Mosquito CTCFs are likely orthologous to the widely-characterized vertebrate CTCFs and potentially also serve an insulating function. As such, CTCF may provide a powerful tool for improving transgene expression in these mosquitoes through the identification of endogenous binding sites.},

We have constructed an initial map of yeast's transcriptional regulatory code by identifying the sequence elements that are bound by regulators under various conditions and that are conserved among Saccharomyces species. The organization of regulatory elements in promoters and the environment-dependent use of these elements by regulators are discussed.

When used to search upstream of apparently coregulated genes, AlignACE finds motifs that often correspond to the DNA binding preferences of transcription factors. We previously used AlignACE to analyze whole genome mRNA expression data. Here, we present a more detailed study of its effectiveness as applied to a variety of groups of genes in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. Published functional catalogs of genes and sets of genes grouped by common name provided 248 groups, resulting in 3311 motifs. In conjunction with this analysis, we present measures for gauging the tendency of a motif to target a given set of genes relative to all other genes in the genome and for gauging the degree to which a motif is preferentially located in a certain distance range upstream of translational start sites. We demonstrate improved methods for comparing and clustering sequence motifs. Many previously identified cis-regulatory elements were found. We also describe previously unidentified motifs, one of which has been verified by experiments in our laboratory. An extensive set of AlignACE runs on randomly selected sets of genes and on sets of genes whose upstream regions contain known transcription factor binding sites serve as controls.},

Recent laboratory successes in the development of virus- and protozoan-resistant mosquito strains make urgent research of gene drive systems capable of moving effector genes into wild populations. A systematic approach to developing safe and effective gene drive systems that includes defining the requirements of the system, identifying naturally occurring or synthetic genetic mechanisms for gene spread upon which drive systems can be based and the successful adaptation of a mechanism to a drive system, should mitigate concerns about using genetically engineered mosquitoes for disease control.},

abstract = {In vivo protein-DNA interactions connect each transcription factor with its direct targets to form a gene network scaffold. To map these protein-DNA interactions comprehensively across entire mammalian genomes, we developed a large-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIPSeq) based on direct ultrahigh-throughput DNA sequencing. This sequence census method was then used to map in vivo binding of the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF; also known as REST, for repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor) to 1946 locations in the human genome. The data display sharp resolution of binding position [+/-50 base pairs (bp)], which facilitated our finding motifs and allowed us to identify noncanonical NRSF-binding motifs. These ChIPSeq data also have high sensitivity and specificity [ROC (receiver operator characteristic) area >/= 0.96] and statistical confidence (P <10(-4)), properties that were important for inferring new candidate interactions. These include key transcription factors in the gene network that regulates pancreatic islet cell development.},

abstract = {In anautogenous mosquitoes, a blood meal is required for activation of genes encoding yolk protein precursors (YPP). Vitellogenin (Vg), the major YPP gene, is transcribed at a very high level following blood meal activation. It is expressed exclusively in the female fat body, the tissue producing most of mosquito hemolymph and immune proteins. In this paper, we analyzed the upstream region of the Aedes aegypti Vg gene in order to identify regulatory elements responsible for its unique expression pattern. To achieve this goal, we analyzed the gene using transgenic Drosophila and Aedes as well as DNA-binding assays. These analyses revealed three regulatory regions in the 2.1 kb upstream portion of the Vg gene. The proximal region containing binding sites to EcR/USP, GATA, C/EBP and HNF3/fkh is required for the correct tissue- and stage-specific expression at a low level. The median region carrying sites for early ecdysone response factors E74 and E75 is responsible for hormonal enhancement of Vg expression. Finally, the distal GATA-rich region is necessary for extremely high expression levels characteristic of the Vg gene. The present work elucidates the molecular basis of blood meal-dependent expression of this mosquito gene, laying the foundation for mosquito-specific expression cassettes with predictable stage and tissue specificity.},

abstract = {Essential roles for GATA factors in the development of endoderm have been reported in various animals. A Drosophila GATA factor gene, serpent (srp, dGATAb, ABF), is expressed in the prospective endoderm, and loss of srp activity causes transformation of the prospective endoderm into ectodermal foregut and hindgut, indicating that srp acts as a selector gene to specify the developmental fate of the endoderm. While srp is expressed in the endoderm only during early stages, it activates a subsequent GATA factor gene, dGATAe, and the latter continues to be expressed specifically in the endoderm throughout life. dGATAe activates various functional genes in the differentiated endodermal midgut. An analogous mode of regulation has been reported in Caenorhabditis elegans, in which a pair of GATA genes, end-1/3, specifies endodermal fate, and a downstream pair of GATA genes, elt-2/7, activates genes in the differentiated endoderm. Functional homology of GATA genes in nature is apparently extendable to vertebrates, because endodermal GATA genes of C. elegans and Drosophila induce endoderm development in Xenopus ectoderm. These findings strongly imply evolutionary conservation of the roles of GATA factors in the endoderm across the protostomes and the deuterostomes.},

abstract = {Ingestion of blood is required for vector mosquitoes to initiate reproductive cycles determining their role as vectors of devastating human diseases. Nutritional signaling plays a pivotal role in regulating mosquito reproduction. Transcription of yolk protein precursor genes is repressed until mosquitoes take blood. Previously, we have shown that to signal the presence of blood in the gut, mosquitoes utilize the target-of-rapamycin (TOR) pathway. The TOR signaling pathway transduces the amino acid signal activating the major yolk protein precursor gene, vitellogenin (Vg). Here we report the identification of a GATA factor (AaGATAa) that is synthesized after a blood meal and acts as a transcriptional activator of Vg. We showed that AaGATAa bound specifically to GATA-binding sites present in the proximal promoter region of the Vg gene and positively regulated Vg expression in transfection assays. RNA interference-mediated knock down of AaGATAa transcript resulted in a significant inhibition of Vg expression in both fat-body tissue culture and blood-fed mosquitoes. AaGATAa mRNA accumulated in the fat body prior to blood feeding. However, translation of GATA was activated by blood feeding because the GATA protein increased dramatically in the fat body of blood-fed mosquitoes. This increase was also reproduced in the fat-body culture stimulated with amino acids. GATA translation was inhibited by rapamycin and cycloheximide as well as by RNA interference-mediated knock down of S6 kinase. These experiments have revealed that the TOR signaling pathway induced by nutritional signaling regulates the translation of a GATA factor, which is the specific transcriptional activator of the Vg gene.},

In fact, the interface automatically starts different runs of the program, each one with different parameters, and provides the user with an overall summary of the results as well as some 'advice' on which motifs look more interesting according to their statistical significance and some simple considerations.

We previously sequenced an R2 cDNA clone from the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. We found the message was upregulated by blood feeding. We now report the sequence of an R2 genomic clone. The gene consists of 4 introns and 5 exons. Both major and minor transcriptional start sites have been identified, and their use differs in sugar-fed versus blood-fed females. The gene contains putative cis-regulatory sites for E2F, Caudal (Cdx) and Dearolf (Dfd). The mosquito R2 gene contains iron-specific regulatory elements immediately upstream of the minimal promoter region. Binding of a factor to the distal putative Cdx site in the -400 region is altered by iron treatment of cells.

abstract = {Transcription factor binding site (TFBS) detection plays an important role in computational biology, with applications in gene finding and gene regulation. The sites are often modeled by gapless profiles, also known as position-weight matrices. Past research has focused on the significance of profile scores (the ability to avoid false positives), but this alone is not enough: The profile must also possess the power to detect the true positive signals. Several completed genomes are now available, and the search for TFBSs is moving to a large scale; so discriminating signal from noise becomes even more challenging. Since TFBS profiles are usually estimated from only a few experimentally confirmed instances, careful regularization is an important issue. We present a novel method that is well suited for this situation. We further develop measures that help in judging profile quality, based on both sensitivity and selectivity of a profile. It is shown that these quality measures can be efficiently computed, and we propose statistically well-founded methods to choose score thresholds. Our findings are applied to the TRANSFAC database of transcription factor binding sites. The results are disturbing: If we insist on a significance level of 5\% in sequences of length 500, only 19\% of the profiles detect a true signal instance with 95\% success probability under varying background sequence compositions.},

abstract = {Elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying stage- and tissue-specific expression of genes activated by a blood meal is of great importance for current efforts directed towards utilizing molecular genetics to develop novel strategies of mosquito and pathogen control. Regulatory regions of such genes can be used to express anti-pathogen effector molecules in engineered vectors in a precise temporal and spatial manner, designed to maximally affect a pathogen. The fat body is a particularly important target for engineering anti-pathogen properties because in insects, it is a potent secretory tissue releasing its products to the hemolymph, an environment or a crossroad for most pathogens. Recently, we have provided proof of this concept by engineering stable transformant lines of Aedes aegypti mosquito, in which the regulatory region A. aegypti vitellogenin (Vg) gene activates high-level fat body-specific expression of a potent anti-bacterial factor, defensin, in response to a blood meal. Further study of the Vg gene utilizing Drosophila and Aedes transformation identified cis-regulatory sites responsible for state- and fat body-specific activation of this gene via a blood-meal-triggered cascade. These analyses revealed three regulatory regions in the 2.1-kb upstream portion of the Vg gene. The proximal region, containing binding sites to EcR/USP, GATA, C/EBP and HNF3/fkh, is required for the correct tissue- and stage-specific expression at a low level. The median region, carrying sites for early ecdysone response factors E74 and E75, is responsible for a stage-specific hormonal enhancement of the Vg expression. Finally, the distal GATA-rich region is necessary for extremely high expression levels characteristic to the Vg gene. Furthermore, our study showed that several transcription factors involved in controlling the Vg gene expression, are themselves targets of the blood meal-mediated regulatory cascade, thus greatly amplifying the effect of this cascade on the Vg gene. This research serves as the foundation for the future design of mosquito-specific expression cassettes with predicted stage- and tissue specificity at the desired levels of transgene expression.},

abstract = {Given the DNA-binding specificities (motifs) of one or more transcription factors, an important bioinformatics problem is to discover significant clusters of binding sites for the transcription factors(s). Such clusters often correspond to cis-regulatory modules mediating regulation of an adjacent gene. In earlier work, we developed the Stubb program that uses a probabilistic model and a maximum likelihood approach to efficiently detect cis-regulatory modules over genomic scales. It may optionally exploit a second related genome to improve module prediction accuracy. We describe here the use of a web-based interface for the Stubb program. The interface is equipped with a special post-processing step for in-depth analysis of specific modules, in order to reveal individual binding sites predicted in the module. The web server may be accessed at the URL http://stubb.rockefeller.edu/.},

abstract = {In the anautogenous mosquito, Aedes aegypti, vitellogenesis is under the strict control of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), which is produced via a blood meal-activated hormonal cascade. Several genes of the ecdysteroid-regulatory hierarchy are conserved between vitellogenesis in mosquitoes and metamorphosis in Drosophila. We report characterization of two isoforms of the mosquito early E74 gene (AaE74), which have a common C-terminal Ets DNA-binding domain and unique N-termini. They exhibited a high level of identity to Drosophila E74 isoforms A and B and showed structural features typical for Ets transcription factors. Both mosquito E74 isoforms bound to an E74 consensus motif C/AGGAA. In the fat body and ovary, the transcript of AaE74 isoform homologous to Drosophila E74B was induced by a blood meal exhibiting its highest level coinciding with the peak of vitellogenesis. In contrast, the transcript of AaE74 isoform homologous to Drosophila E74A was activated at the termination of vitellogenesis. These findings suggest that AaE74A and AaE74B isoforms play different roles in regulation of vitellogenesis in mosquitoes.},

@article{Takane2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In many eukaryotes, microRNAs (miRNAs) bind to complementary sites in the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and regulate their expression at the stage of translation. Recent studies have revealed that many miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved; however, the evolution of their target genes has yet to be systematically characterized. We sought to elucidate a set of conserved miRNA/target-gene pairs and to analyse the mechanism underlying miRNA-mediated gene regulation in the early stage of bilaterian evolution. RESULTS: Initially, we extracted five evolutionarily conserved miRNAs (let-7, miR-1, miR-124, miR-125/lin-4, and miR-34) among five diverse bilaterian animals. Subsequently, we designed a procedure to predict evolutionarily conserved miRNA/target-gene pairs by introducing orthologous gene information. As a result, we extracted 31 orthologous miRNA/target-gene pairs that were conserved among at least four diverse bilaterian animals; the prediction set showed prominent enrichment of orthologous miRNA/target-gene pairs that were verified experimentally. Approximately 84\% of the target genes were regulated by three miRNAs (let-7, miR-1, and miR-124) and their function was classified mainly into the following categories: development, muscle formation, cell adhesion, and gene regulation. We used a reporter gene assay to experimentally verify the downregulation of six candidate pairs (out of six tested pairs) in HeLa cells. CONCLUSIONS: The application of our new method enables the identification of 31 miRNA/target-gene pairs that were expected to have been regulated from the era of the common bilaterian ancestor. The downregulation of all six candidate pairs suggests that orthologous information contributed to the elucidation of the primordial set of genes that has been regulated by miRNAs; it was also an efficient tool for the elimination of false positives from the predicted candidates. In conclusion, our study identified potentially important miRNA-target pairs that were evolutionarily conserved throughout diverse bilaterian animals and that may provide new insights into early-stage miRNA functions.},

A search for tandem repeats in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome revealed that the nucleosome-free region directly upstream of genes (the promoter region) is enriched in repeats. As many as 25\% of all gene promoters contain tandem repeat sequences. Genes driven by these repeat-containing promoters show significantly higher rates of transcriptional divergence. Variations in repeat length result in changes in expression and local nucleosome positioning. Tandem repeats are variable elements in promoters that may facilitate evolutionary tuning of gene expression by affecting local chromatin structure.},

It is now possible to generate gigabase pairs of DNA sequence within a week without time-consuming cloning or massive infrastructure. This technology has recently been applied to the development of 'RNA-seq' techniques for sequencing cDNA from various organisms, with the goal of characterizing entire transcriptomes. These methods provide unprecedented resolution and depth of data, enabling simultaneous quantification of gene expression, discovery of novel transcripts and exons, and measurement of splicing efficiency. We present here a validated protocol for nonstrand-specific transcriptome sequencing via RNA-seq, describing the library preparation process and outlining the bioinformatic analysis procedure. While sample preparation and sequencing take a fairly short period of time (1-2 weeks), the downstream analysis is by far the most challenging and time-consuming aspect and can take weeks to months, depending on the experimental objectives.},

abstract = {A key component in genome sequence analysis is the identification of regions of the genome that contain regulatory information. In higher eukaryotes, this information is organized into modular units called cis-regulatory modules. Each module contains multiple binding sites for a specific combination of several transcription factors. In this article, we propose a hidden Markov model (HMM) to identify transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). For a given genomic sequence, we first select potential TFBSs from a large database (e.g., TRANSFAC), then construct an HMM where the TFBSs are only counted when they occur within a specialized CRM state. The novel features of the proposed method include that it does not assume a small set of TFBSs for a given gene; on the other hand, the method utilizes information from a large collection of well-characterized TFBSs and therefore is computationally more efficient and robust than the de novo methods. Our approach is applied to three data sets with experimentally evaluated TFBSs. The method shows better specificity and sensitivity than other similar computational tools in identifying CRMs and TFBSs. The executable codes of our programs and module predictions across the fly Drosophila genome are available at www.stat.purdue.edu/\~{} jingwu/module/.},

abstract = {We introduce the GibbsModule algorithm for de novo detection of cis-regulatory motifs and modules in eukaryote genomes. GibbsModule models the coexpressed genes within one species as sharing a core cis-regulatory motif and each homologous gene group as sharing a homologous cis-regulatory module (CRM), characterized by a similar composition of motifs. Without using a predetermined alignment result, GibbsModule iteratively updates the core motif shared by coexpressed genes and traces the homologous CRMs that contain the core motif. GibbsModule achieved substantial improvements in both precision and recall as compared with peer algorithms on a number of synthetic and real data sets. Applying GibbsModule to analyze the binding regions of the Kr\"{u}ppel-like factor (KLF) transcription factor in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we discovered a motif that differs from a previously published KLF motif identified by a SELEX experiment, but the new motif is consistent with mutagenesis analysis. The SOX2 motif was found to be a collaborating motif to the KLF motif in ESCs. We used quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis to test whether GibbsModule could distinguish functional and nonfunctional binding sites. All seven tested binding sites in GibbsModule-predicted CRMs had higher ChIP signals as compared with the other seven tested binding sites located outside of predicted CRMs. GibbsModule is available at (http://biocomp.bioen.uiuc.edu/GibbsModule).},

abstract = {Drosophila Piwi-family proteins have been implicated in transposon control. Here, we examine piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) associated with each Drosophila Piwi protein and find that Piwi and Aubergine bind RNAs that are predominantly antisense to transposons, whereas Ago3 complexes contain predominantly sense piRNAs. As in mammals, the majority of Drosophila piRNAs are derived from discrete genomic loci. These loci comprise mainly defective transposon sequences, and some have previously been identified as master regulators of transposon activity. Our data suggest that heterochromatic piRNA loci interact with potentially active, euchromatic transposons to form an adaptive system for transposon control. Complementary relationships between sense and antisense piRNA populations suggest an amplification loop wherein each piRNA-directed cleavage event generates the 5' end of a new piRNA. Thus, sense piRNAs, formed following cleavage of transposon mRNAs may enhance production of antisense piRNAs, complementary to active elements, by directing cleavage of transcripts from master control loci.},

abstract = {The fibrinogen-related protein family (FREP, also known as FBN) is an evolutionarily conserved immune gene family found in mammals and invertebrates. It is the largest pattern recognition receptor gene family in Anopheles gambiae, with as many as 59 putative members, while the Drosophila melanogaster genome has only 14 known FREP members. Our sequence and phylogenetic analysis suggest that this remarkable gene expansion in the mosquito is the result of tandem duplication of the fibrinogen domain. We found that the majority of the FREP genes displayed immune-responsive transcription after challenge with bacteria, fungi, or Plasmodium, and these expression patterns correlated strongly with gene phylogeny and chromosomal location. Using RNAi-mediated gene-silencing assays, we further demonstrated that some FREP members are essential factors of the mosquito innate immune system that are required for maintaining immune homeostasis, and members of this family have complementary and synergistic functions. One of the most potent anti-Plasmodium FREP proteins, FBN9, was found to interact with both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and strongly co-localized with both rodent and human malaria parasites in the mosquito midgut epithelium, suggesting that its defensive activity involves direct interaction with the pathogen. Interestingly, FBN9 formed dimers that bound to the bacterial surfaces with different affinities. Our findings indicate that the A. gambiae FREP gene family plays a central role in the mosquito innate immune system and provides an expanded pattern recognition and anti-microbial defense repertoire.},

abstract = {Correct temporal and spatial gene expression during metazoan development relies on combinatorial interactions between different transcription factors. As a consequence, cis-regulatory elements often colocalize in clusters termed cis-regulatory modules. These may have requirements on organizational features such as spacing, order and helical phasing (periodic spacing) between binding sites. Due to the turning of the DNA helix, a small modification of the distance between a pair of sites may sometimes drastically disrupt function, while insertion of a full helical turn of DNA (10-11 bp) between cis elements may cause functionality to be restored. Recently, de novo motif discovery methods which incorporate organizational properties such as colocalization and order preferences have been developed, but there are no tools which incorporate periodic spacing into the model.},

abstract = {Motif discovery is essential for deciphering regulatory codes from high throughput genomic data, such as those from ChIP-chip/seq experiments. However, there remains a lack of effective and efficient methods for the identification of long and gapped motifs in many relevant tools reported to date. We describe here an automated tool that allows for de novo discovery of transcription factor binding sites, regardless of whether the motifs are long or short, gapped or contiguous.},
