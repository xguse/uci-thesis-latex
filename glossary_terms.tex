description={a measure of the linear correlation between two variables, resulting in a value between +1 and −1, where 1 is perfect positive correlation, 0 is no correlation, and −1 is perfect negative correlation.}}


\newglossaryentry{functional-genomics}{name={functional genomics},
description={an approach to molecular biology that attempts to incorporate much of the varied wealth of data produced by modern ``Omics'' projects to describe the functions and interactions of the entire genome; it specifically focuses on dynamic aspects of the genome such as transcription, translation, regulatory, and protein–protein (or protein-DNA) interactions, as opposed to the static aspects of the genomic information such as DNA sequence or structures}}

\newglossaryentry{Git}{name={Git},
description={In software development, Git is a distributed revision control and source code management system with an emphasis on speed.
Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server.
Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2. \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)}}}

\newglossaryentry{TuxProt}{name={Tuxedo Protocol},
description={an integrated RNA-Seq analysis protocol consisting of the following co-developed programs: Bowtie, Tophat, Cufflinks, Cuffmerge, Cuffdiff, and CummeRbund.  An overview figure and further description can be found here: \url{http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v7/n3/fig_tab/nprot.2012.016_F2.html}}}

\newglossaryentry{gene-drive}{name={gene drive},
description={molecular genetic tactics that cause a linked trait or gene to spread through a population at faster rates than expected based on fitness alone; generally operating independently of natural selection and genetic drift}}
